At high levels of COVID-19, the CDC recommends all individuals wear masks in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status. \n",

This is the highest number of cases since Jan. 29, when there were 544 active cases on campus. In addition, there are  123 cases among graduate and professional students, a slight increase from last week’s case total of 103, and 85 cases among faculty and staff members, a figure that has more than doubled for the second week in a row. \n",

Reported cases continue to increase even after the College’s decision to make asymptomatic testing optional, which took effect on April 10. \n",
      "The figure is made up of 196 undergraduate students, 103 graduate or professional students and 40 faculty members and staff. The number of active cases of COVID-19 in graduate and professional students more than doubled in two days, increasing from 42 cases on April 11.\n",
      "April 11 | 10:30 p.m.\n",
      "COVID-19 cases on campus continue to increase — the College COVID-19 Dashboard reported 199 active COVID-19 cases, up from the 155 reported on April 6. The figure includes 133 undergraduates, 42 graduate and professional students and 24 faculty members and staff. The biggest jump in active cases comes from undergraduates, which increased by 55 cases from last Wednesday. \n",
      "As of April 10, asymptomatic testing became optional at the College, though students will still have access to in-person and drop-off testing options, according to a March 30 email from executive vice president Rick Mills and provost David Kotz. \n",
      "According to the dashboard, 97.9% of the community is fully vaccinated, the same as last week. Meanwhile, 96.1% are up to date on their vaccinations — meaning they have received a booster shot — in a 0.2% increase from last week. \n",

This number includes 78 among undergraduates, 66 among graduate and professional students and 11 among faculty and staff. The sharpest rise was among undergraduates, up 49 from 29 cases on March 30. According to the dashboard, 97.9% of the community is fully vaccinated, with 95.9% up to date with their vaccinations — meaning they have received a booster shot. \n",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the positivity rate for tests in Grafton County is 1.79% as of April 3, a 0.55% drop over the last seven days.

      "On March 30 — the third day of classes in a term with fewer Covid restrictions — the Dartmouth COVID-19 dashboard displayed 114 active cases, including 29 among undergraduates, 77 among graduate and professional students and eight among faculty and staff. 98% of the Dartmouth community is fully vaccinated, with 94.6% up to date on their vaccinations, according to the dashboard. Community members classified as “up to date” on vaccinations have received a booster shot.\n",
      "According to a March 17 email from the College, the dashboard will no longer display positivity rates or the number of people in isolation. This term, starting on April 10, Dartmouth will move away from weekly surveillance testing to an “as-needed testing model,” according to the email. Additionally, the email noted that Dartmouth leadership will continue to consult guidance at the federal, state and local levels, alongside scientific guidance, to determine “effective metrics” for the ongoing pandemic response. \n",
      "College spokesperson Diana Lawrence wrote in an emailed statement that the College anticipated an increase in cases as students returned from spring break. \n",
      "“We will be following these numbers closely over the coming weeks to identify whether the case counts continue to rise after start-of-term testing, or if they stabilize or decline,” she wrote. \n",
      "Lawrence wrote that students were not required to complete pre-arrival tests this term, so the positive cases reflected on the dashboard were detected in both PCR and antigen tests conducted on campus and tests taken in the Upper Valley. She  added that the “relatively high case counts” for graduate students relative to undergraduates is due to the earlier semester start date for the Tuck School of Business, leading to an additional week of testing among graduate students reported on the dashboard. \n",
      "The Dartmouth will post short COVID-19 updates here throughout the 2022 spring term. Major developments, such as policy announcements, may be posted separately as their own article. Check back here for updates on current case counts and other campus developments.\n",

      "At the beginning of 2021, Olivia Rodrigo skyrocketed into fame. Her publicity and marketing have sparked a new kind of popularity amongst not only the youth, but also young adults who resonate with her genuine storytelling. Rodrigo’s fame and acknowledgement on social media platforms, such as TikTok, illustrate the extent to which a generation living through a pandemic was hungry for content and musical inspiration. She has also taken on a nostalgic aesthetic, as she wears clothing reminiscent of the early 2000s, includes trendy filmmaking tactics in her music videos and weaves angsty rock elements within her songs. \n",
      "For Rodrigo, her rapid increase in popularity is notably shown through the numbers. “SOUR”’s first week on global Spotify accumulated 385 million streams, becoming the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist, passing the record formerly held by Ariana Grande's “Thank U, Next” (2019). Rodrigo now has more than 44 million monthly listeners. \n",
      "By releasing “drivers license” in January 2021 and “SOUR” in May 2021, Rodrigo’s timing played a monumental role in rising to the top of the Hot 100 Billboard chart. Stuck indoors due to the pandemic, members of Gen Z were prone to invest in many forms of multimedia and entertainment. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor to her success was her mild fame from Disney Channel — which later spun into a dramatic love triangle perpetuated by TikTok. Rodrigo’s earlier recognition in the realm of songwriting and singing came through her role in the original Disney+ show, “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” \n",
      "In the series, Rodrigo plays the female protagonist, Nini, alongside her co-star Joshua Bassett as Ricky. Rumors sparked about the two having an off-screen relationship. This relationship was seemingly confirmed by fans on social media with the release of her debut single and overnight sensation “drivers license.” \n",
      "Specifically, TikTok became flooded with videos that deeply analyzed every word of the atmospheric power ballad. Fans fixated on the lyric “And you're probably with that blonde girl,” speculating that it referred to fellow Disney actress Sabrina Carpenter. The ensuing commentary on social media reveals how people gravitated to the situation for entertainment while stuck at home, further promoting interest in Rodrigo and her songwriting.\n",
      "It is interesting to examine whether the immense success of “drivers license” was a lucky coincidence or strategic marketing. Female artists are often able to thrive in the music industry as they ruminate on their past relationships, heartbreak and public drama.

Whether the publicity gossip was plotted by her team or not, Rodrigo and her team still fueled the mystery of the situation by neither confirming nor denying the breakup. Instead, they continued to further promote their next singles, leaving the public to imagine and make assumptions.\n",
      "Rodrigo took the overwhelming success from her debut single to surprise fans in March 2021 with hidden messages in social media posts, hinting at a potential new single release for April 2021. Her themed posts — including short clips of ice cream melting and beachy images — led up to her announcement of her second single, “deja vu.” \n",
      "Fans noticed that this social media tactic was similar to that of her female artist inspiration, Taylor Swift, who also deleted all of her Instagram posts to announce her album “Reputation.” Though Rodrigo was subsequently accused of copying other female artists’ in their vocals, lyrics, rhythms and publicity methods, she continues to carve her own path and style. She has mentioned that she draws upon other female artists such as Swift, Gracie Abrams and Fiona Apple, which helps her formulate her own appealing image in the media while also maintaining originality. \n",
      "Despite the claims of unoriginality in her songs — “good 4 u,” which ties into Paramore’s song “Misery Business,” and “deja vu,” which shares elements of its bridge to Swift’s “Cruel Summer” — Rodrigo is still taking creative liberty in her work. She interpolated similar melodies to produce a sound that is uniquely true to herself and her style. \n",
      "Just as Rodrigo related deeply with other female artists, she seeks to reciprocate the way her fans have connected with her. With social isolation, much of Gen Z longed for deeper connections and parasocial relationships with their favorite artists. Rodrigo delivered copious behind-the-scenes content and insider messages with her relatable social media presence. The newly premiered “driving home 2 u” documentary also explored the creation of her album with producer Dan Nigro.\n",
      "In June 2021, Rodrigo’s creative team played upon this aspect of youthfulness and being in high school in order to connect with her fans. Rodrigo hosted an in-person watch party at The Grove in Los Angeles and released the “SOUR Prom Concert Film” to appeal to the high school experience fans were missing while at home. \n",
      "Rodrigo’s relatability to teenage girls is a prime element that her marketing team picked up on early in her musical career. Her entire brand is composed of high school breakup nostalgia including composition books, stickers and a 90s and early 2000s wardrobe. The consistent color palette for her album includes purple hues and multicolored illustrations of butterflies, flowers, cars and even grape-flavored Sour Patch candy. \n",
      "Still, her art of songwriting resonates with not only the younger generation, but also young adults as “SOUR” encapsulates feelings of love, betrayal, heartbreak, jealousy and other complex human emotions. \n",
      "Being of Filipino-American descent, Rodrigo’s triple Grammy win also sheds light on Asian American talent on stage. Her wins at the American Music Awards, iHeartRadio awards and the Grammys as well as her first stage performances on Saturday Night Live and The Brits are visions of victory for the different communities she stands for. Thus, diverse audiences can feel as if they have “won” with her.\n",
      "While Rodrigo’s success was bolstered by her early entrance into the entertainment industry through Disney, she adopted a new brand saddened by heartbreak but resilient in reflection. Her authenticity, her honest talent and her unabashed presentation of emotions sticks with her listeners and sets a new standard for the music industry.\n",

      "At the beginning of 2021, Olivia Rodrigo skyrocketed into fame. Her publicity and marketing have sparked a new kind of popularity amongst not only the youth, but also young adults who resonate with her genuine storytelling. Rodrigo’s fame and acknowledgement on social media platforms, such as TikTok, illustrate the extent to which a generation living through a pandemic was hungry for content and musical inspiration. She has also taken on a nostalgic aesthetic, as she wears clothing reminiscent of the early 2000s, includes trendy filmmaking tactics in her music videos and weaves angsty rock elements within her songs. \n",
      "For Rodrigo, her rapid increase in popularity is notably shown through the numbers. “SOUR”’s first week on global Spotify accumulated 385 million streams, becoming the biggest opening week for an album by a female artist, passing the record formerly held by Ariana Grande's “Thank U, Next” (2019). Rodrigo now has more than 44 million monthly listeners. \n",
      "By releasing “drivers license” in January 2021 and “SOUR” in May 2021, Rodrigo’s timing played a monumental role in rising to the top of the Hot 100 Billboard chart. Stuck indoors due to the pandemic, members of Gen Z were prone to invest in many forms of multimedia and entertainment. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor to her success was her mild fame from Disney Channel — which later spun into a dramatic love triangle perpetuated by TikTok. Rodrigo’s earlier recognition in the realm of songwriting and singing came through her role in the original Disney+ show, “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.” \n",
      "In the series, Rodrigo plays the female protagonist, Nini, alongside her co-star Joshua Bassett as Ricky. Rumors sparked about the two having an off-screen relationship. This relationship was seemingly confirmed by fans on social media with the release of her debut single and overnight sensation “drivers license.” \n",
      "Specifically, TikTok became flooded with videos that deeply analyzed every word of the atmospheric power ballad. Fans fixated on the lyric “And you're probably with that blonde girl,” speculating that it referred to fellow Disney actress Sabrina Carpenter. The ensuing commentary on social media reveals how people gravitated to the situation for entertainment while stuck at home, further promoting interest in Rodrigo and her songwriting.\n",
      "It is interesting to examine whether the immense success of “drivers license” was a lucky coincidence or strategic marketing. Female artists are often able to thrive in the music industry as they ruminate on their past relationships, heartbreak and public drama. Rodrigo’s emphasis on the passion of songwriting sticks with fans as a genuine element of her character in an age when music’s lyrical content has become rather generalized and impersonal. Whether the publicity gossip was plotted by her team or not, Rodrigo and her team still fueled the mystery of the situation by neither confirming nor denying the breakup.

      "Booth, Dartmouth’s DJ collective founded in 2016, is a social and art group that provides DJ services to Greek houses and other functions on campus. The collective is currently expanding their services by branching out to cover more events to fit a growing campus demand for DJs. \n",
      "“Our main purpose is to provide DJ services … but more than that, we think of ourselves as an art collective on campus,” Booth’s founding member Juhnwi Kim ’22 said. “There’s a very strong DJ culture at Dartmouth [and] we provide high quality service.”\n",
      "Booth performs primarily at fraternities and sororities, where it is hired for on-nights, semis and formals. It also puts on Booth raves, which are shows typically hosted at Chi Gamma Epsilon and Scarlett Hall. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Booth performs at campus events, ranging from shows at the Hopkins Center for the Arts and the Thayer School of Engineering to the Friday Night Rock performances at Collis Commonground. A couple weeks ago, the Programming Board hired Booth to play during intermissions at Battle of the Bands, according to Booth’s director, Luis Verdi ’22. \n",
      "“We’re trying to expand beyond Greek houses. Something that we really value is a relationship with the school,” Verdi said.\n",
      "The members of Booth all have their own distinct styles, which means that every show is unique and has a different aesthetic. For example, Verdi specializes in dance, pop and electronic dance music, while new member Raegan Padula ’24 said she prefers house and techno. \n",
      "“We all have different niches that we love to explore in music, and that combined with our ability to get a crowd going is so important to bring new sonic spaces to campus,” Padula said. \n",
      "Booth also encourages its current members to incorporate new styles. Padula is excited to experiment in her Booth performances over sophomore summer when she returns from London, where she is currently studying electronic music. \n",
      "“Getting to go around the city and take some of the experimental stuff done here and grunge and grime and bringing those back to campus is going to be really exciting,” Padula said. “[Booth’s] function is to introduce students to new flavors and new styles.”\n",
      "Despite each member’s niches, Kim said that Booth has a “commercial front,” in which they still play pop music that people recognize and enjoy. \n",
      "“My favorite thing is just seeing a crowd of people singing the words. To me, there’s nothing cooler as a performer than seeing everyone excited about what you’re putting on,” Verdi said. “Having that liberty to say ‘I'm in control, but I want to make sure that you’re all having fun with me.’ Because it’s about having fun but also making sure everyone else is having fun.” \n",
      "Booth members meet once a week to discuss upcoming shows and contribute to external projects, such as their SoundCloud account. Padula said that at these weekly meetings, people will bring their boards and mix songs back and forth between each other. \n",
      "“[This] is a real challenge, especially since some of us have quite different tastes,” Padula said. “To go from hip hop to experimental funk is a really fun switch.”\n",
      "New members typically join Booth during their freshman year, with a variety of experience levels. Some are experienced DJs, while others simply show interest in getting started. According to Verdi, Booth’s expanding popularity on campus makes it easier to recruit. \n",
      "“Over the years we've gotten a lot more interest over time,” Verdi said. “It feels cool to have that presence on campus.”\n",
      "Verdi said he first experimented with DJing in high school, when he taught himself how to play using a friend’s equipment and performed at his school’s dance. He discovered the opportunity to continue his passion for DJing in college through Booth.\n",
      "“Once I got [to Dartmouth], I felt like [DJing] was something I wanted to get back into and keep working on,” Verdi said. “Once I found out about Booth, met people in Booth, I was completely sold.”\n",
      "After joining, new members are trained in the winter quarter. According to Kim, winter training consists of mastering techniques and learning how to navigate the Dartmouth music scene.\n",
      "“We make sure that they are technically proficient enough to perform at a high level that people require and want,” Kim said. “Our members are not only DJs, but they produce and are in bands, so we like to think we are one of the leading musical voices on campus.”\n",
      "Kim helped start Booth in 2016 when he and a group of ’20s identified the need for a DJ group at Dartmouth. He said they were inspired by the Boiler Room group, which Kim said had a “more varied music scene.” \n",
      "In the beginning, Booth started performing at BarHop, an event held every Thursday at the Hopkins Center for the Arts. Booth then transitioned into DJing fraternity and sorority formals through personal connections. Now, Kim said that Greek houses ask Booth to perform at their events.\n",
      "In addition to providing DJ services, Booth provides a sense of community for its members. Verdi commented on how the social aspect is his favorite part, and how he still keeps in touch with Booth alumni. \n",

      "As the effects of inflation, labor shortages and the prospect of a recession loom over the national economy, Hanover business owners said they have faced unique challenges in finding ways to adapt their business models. Business owners also mentioned that the high living costs of the Upper Valley and seasonal flow of business around the Collegepose further difficulties with employment.\n",
      "According to The New York Times, the consumer price index, which measures general prices of goods and services in an economy, was 8.5% higher in March 2022 than it was a year ago, marking the highest inflation rate in 30 years.\n",

      "Bryan Smith, owner of Hanover poster store rpmNH, said plastic top holders for posters have doubled in price since the start of the pandemic, while Lemon Tree Gifts owner Melissa Haas said the cost of shipping for her business has “quadrupled” in the past six months.\n",
      "“I don’t think there’s a single company I’ve worked with who hasn’t been affected [by inflation],” Haas said. “Some companies are still putting heavy surcharges on overseas shipments to account for shipping costs … and they’re getting more and more comfortable [doing so].”\n",
      "Economics professor Elisabeth Curtis said that while the causes of the current wave of inflation are not fully understood, it is likely driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain shortages. In addition, inflationary prices may have been “exacerbated” by the ongoing war in Ukraine which has disrupted food and energy markets. Curtis also pointed towards the possibility of a wage-price spiral — a situation in which consumers spend more now in expectation of future price increases — which creates “self-fulfilling inflationary expectations.” \n",
      "“When I teach my [macroeconomics] class, I’ve had to teach [inflation] in an imaginary situation,” Curtis said. “We haven’t had inflationary pressures for a very long time, so we’ve almost forgotten what inflation looks like and how to live with it.”\n",
      "In response to rising production costs, Haas said she is trying to “meet in the middle” by increasing prices by “a few dollars here and there” for customers, but she said she has stopped purchasing some items because of large cost increases.\n",

      "In addition, both Smith and Haas said that ongoing supply chain shortages have affected their ability to purchase items. Haas added that because of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, some manufacturers have been unable to produce items like manicure sets or nail files, which they have “typically been able to get for years.”\n",

      "“I don’t know if I can buy them again in time [for next Christmas], so I’m [buying] things now that I wouldn’t normally,” she said.\n",
      "Beyond the problems created by inflation, Curtis said that “the [United States] is closer to full employment than ever,” but there is still a persistent “mismatch” in the labor market as employers cannot find employees with desired skills. She added that Hanover’s businesses face unique challenges as most full-time job seekers, apart from those associated with the College, do not live in Hanover due to the high cost of living.\n",
      "Smith said that although he has not faced difficulties hiring part-time workers, he has been unable to fill full-time management positions. Similarly, Haas said the term “labor shortage” is the “understatement of the century,” adding that “it’s been a huge problem” as she has been unable to hire a manager for several months now.\n",
      "Curtis said that the “gazillion-dollar question” now is whether the U.S. will soon head into a recession. She noted that economists disagree on whether interest rate increases can rein in inflation, adding that the Federal Reserve must strike a balance by understanding the causes of inflation and acting appropriately.\n",
      "The last time inflation rates were this high — the late 1970s and early 1980s — the Federal Reserve sharply increased interest rates and tightened monetary policy to reduce inflation, contributing to a recession and increased unemployment rates, according to Curtis.\n",

      "As the effects of inflation, labor shortages and the prospect of a recession loom over the national economy, Hanover business owners said they have faced unique challenges in finding ways to adapt their business models. Business owners also mentioned that the high living costs of the Upper Valley and seasonal flow of business around the Collegepose further difficulties with employment.\n",
      "According to The New York Times, the consumer price index, which measures general prices of goods and services in an economy, was 8.5% higher in March 2022 than it was a year ago, marking the highest inflation rate in 30 years.\n",

      "Bryan Smith, owner of Hanover poster store rpmNH, said plastic top holders for posters have doubled in price since the start of the pandemic, while Lemon Tree Gifts owner Melissa Haas said the cost of shipping for her business has “quadrupled” in the past six months.\n",
      "“I don’t think there’s a single company I’ve worked with who hasn’t been affected [by inflation],” Haas said. “Some companies are still putting heavy surcharges on overseas shipments to account for shipping costs … and they’re getting more and more comfortable [doing so].”\n",
      "Economics professor Elisabeth Curtis said that while the causes of the current wave of inflation are not fully understood, it is likely driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain shortages. In addition, inflationary prices may have been “exacerbated” by the ongoing war in Ukraine which has disrupted food and energy markets. Curtis also pointed towards the possibility of a wage-price spiral — a situation in which consumers spend more now in expectation of future price increases — which creates “self-fulfilling inflationary expectations.” \n",

      "As inflation has caused a surge in prices worldwide, food prices for items across Dartmouth Dining have increased — but the value of meal swipes has not grown to compensate for these higher prices. Some students have expressed grievances about the difference between the allotted price of a meal swipe and rising food prices.\n",
      "“It makes me upset because I feel like every time I buy something, it’s not covered by my swipes,” Anna Pitts ’23 said.“Then I am having to spend my DBA, which seems kind of like it defeats the whole purpose of having meal swipes.” \n",
      "Swipes offer unlimited dine-in at the Class of 1953 Commons, but can also be used for  meal equivalencies at Collis Cafe, Novack Cafe and Courtyard Cafe. The current equivalencies for swipes allotted to each meal period are $5.25 for breakfast, $7.50 for lunch and $10.00 for dinner. However, rising food prices have combined with meal equivalencies that have not changed in value, preventing students from purchasing as much food as they could before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not a person who likes to go to Foco, so it doesn’t feel worth it to eat there when I would rather be getting the food I would prefer from Collis or Novack,” Pitts said. “But it’s kind of a double standard because if I go [to Collis or Novack], my meals aren’t being covered by the meal swipe, but if I go to Foco, where it is being covered, I’m not able to get what I want.”\n",
      "Sophia He ’23 said that she remembered during her freshman year, Collis smoothies used to cost “around $4.75,” but now they are “over six dollars,” which exceeds the meal equivalency of a breakfast swipe.\n",
      "“A breakfast swipe definitely used to cover the cost of a smoothie,” He said. \n",
      "Dartmouth Dining does not plan on changing the value of meal swipes, according to director of Dartmouth Dining Jon Plodzik. \n",
      "“Meal equivalencies will never be a perfect method to cover the varied eating habits of the student population, and honestly, we are one of the few schools that even offer them at the level that we do, just because of that challenge,” Plodzik wrote in an emailed statement.\n",
      "Increasing prices of food are the result of economic inflation across the world, according to economics professor Patricia Anderson. She added that inflation is an aggregate of various factors contributing to food shortages. Globally, Anderson said that the Avian flu is killing off chickens and driving up the prices of eggs, the war in Ukraine has disrupted meat production and protests at the southern   border against Texas Governor Greg Abbotthave upset the supply chain of produce coming from Mexico.\n",
      "“There’s just a perfect storm of inflationary pressures going on right now,” Anderson said. “It’s more of an aggregate supply [and] demand story than a pure monetary story, and so I think it’s a question of when does supply catch up to demand.” \n",
      "Plodzik wrote that Dartmouth is unique in its meal plan components, as most schools do not offer transfer of meal plan swipes into equivalencies at other campus dining locations. He added that other schools that do have this transfer feature often have restrictions on what discretionary funds can and can’t be used for, unlike Dartmouth. Nonetheless, changing the value of meal swipes would have to happen during the College budgeting process, he wrote.\n",
      "“We have not changed the equivalency prices since my arrival in 2016 and doing so would need to be part of the College’s budget process,” Plodzik wrote. “The all-you-care to eat venue of 1953 Commons should always be considered the primary venue for meal swipe use based on value and variety. The menu there is very comprehensive and should meet the needs of every guest.” \n",

      "Marijuana has long been present in music genres like psychedelic rock and reggae, even before the emergence of marijuana usage into the cultural mainstream. Despite historically being stigmatized, weed has progressively become decriminalized and legalized across the country, and recreational usage no longer draws as much scrutiny as it once did. And while marijuana, like any other drug, has the potential for dependency and abuse, it is better known for its euphoric and stimulating psychoactive effects. These effects have inspired musicians throughout history, enhancing their music and creativity. \n",
      "Weed can be first seen in popular music way back in the 1920s, especially in jazz. Legendary trumpeter Louis Armstrong was a staunch aficionado of marijuana’s soothing and creative properties, recording an instrumental track called “Muggles” in 1928, which was named after a slang term for weed. But weed was not mainstream at the time — it is important to note that weed’s association with Black culture and music gave it a negative connotation in society and law enforcement that still persists to this day. \n",
      "Perhaps one of Bob Dylan’s biggest claims to fame besides his own music is introducing John Lennon to cannabis. The Beatles would go on to introduce weed (and psychedelics) into the broader mainstream of white counterculture with subtle references in songs like “Got to Get You in My Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now these things aren't drugs; they just bend your mind a little,\" Dylan said about opium and cannabis in a 1963 Playboy interview. \"I think everybody's mind should be bent once in a while.\"\n",
      "With the popularization of the electric guitar, the effects of spacy guitar pedals birthed psychedelic rock, in which a simple guitar riff could evolve into a web of sonic complexity. This counterculture peaked with the 1967 “Summer of Love” and the landmark 1969 Woodstock Festival headlined by artists like Jimi Hendrix and The Jefferson Airplane who performed psychedelic sets.\n",
      "The influence of psychedelics and cannabis on rock music largely retreated in the 1970s, though marijuana remained a common theme in Caribbean music styles like reggae and dancehall. Beyond his influence on reggae and ska, Bob Marley was one of the most prolific advocates for cannabis of his time. As a Rastafarian, Marley used cannabis as a natural aid for spiritual meditation and religious growth.\n",
      "Cannabis was a recurring theme in the 80s and 90s era of gangster rap, again entrenched in a culture of a marginalized minority demonized by conservatives and president Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs. Snoop Dogg, once a rapper on the streets of Long Beach who turned into a pop culture icon, remains one of the most recognizable figureheads of cannabis consumption.\n",
      "Today, weed’s omnipresence can be seen across the musical spectrum, from down-tempo indie pop to gritty SoundCloud trap. In the past decade, artists as varied as Lana Del Rey’s “High by the Beach”, Bruno Mars’ “Smokin’ out the Window” and Future’s “Drankin n Smokin” have all implicitly or explicitly referenced cannabis usage in their songs. Weed is no longer perceived as belonging to hippie or Black culture — I doubt college students today perceive smoking weed as the act of rebellion it once was. One could even argue weed culture has become mainstream because it has been so commonly adopted by white musicians.\n",
      "It is interesting to compare marijuana’s perception and presence in music to that of other drugs — especially alcohol, a party drug so ubiquitous in media that it is often not treated as a drug. Alcohol also tends to lend itself more to higher-energy music — anecdotally, it pairs better with the monotonic repetitive and driving nature of electronic dance music than spacey psychedelic rock or vibey rhythm and blues. Recurring mentions of drug usage in contemporary hip-hop often pair marijuana with MDMA, cocaine and other drugs, further blurring the distinction with the low potential harm of marijuana. But the accessible psychoactive properties of marijuana also place it as a primary gateway influence of the umbrella of psychedelia: Including genres like acid jazz, chillwave, hypnagogic pop, psychedelic rock, psytrance and trip hop.\n",
      "Given the social stigma against cannabis usage in academic and professional circles, the interplay of weed and music remains largely an unscholarly endeavor. However, there’s a growing body of interdisciplinary research on musicology, neuroscience and psychology.\n",
      "Jörg Fachner, a professor of music, health and the brain at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK, explained the relationship between marijuana and music in an interview with Vice Magazine. \n",
      "“[Marijuana] works like a psycho-acoustic enhancer,” Fachner said. “That means you are more able to absorb, to focus on something, and to have a bit of a broader spectrum. It doesn't change the music; it doesn't change the ear functioning. Obviously it changes the way we perceive ear space in music.”\n",
      "Daniel J. Levitin, music psychologist and professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at McGill University, explained how marijuana changes the brain to enhance the effect of music in his book “The World in Six Songs.”\n",
      "“THC — the active ingredient — is known to stimulate the brain's natural pleasure centers, while also disrupting short-term memory,” Levitin said. “The disruption of short-term memory thrusts listeners into the moment of the music as it unfolds; unable to explicitly keep in mind what has just been played, or to think ahead to what might be played, people stoned on pot tend to hear music from note to note.”\n",
      "In other words, weed allows a listener to solely zone into the music. Compared to other art forms, music is strictly temporal, unfolding with time on a predetermined path. Music is a natural complement to being high — unlike reading a book or watching a movie, you don’t have to consciously rationalize the music. The euphoric sensation lies in our brain’s pattern recognition ability to identify harmonics, melody and rhythm. Weed’s ability to trigger “hyper-priming” — or connecting to seemingly abstract and unrelated concepts — may lead to more creative lyrical interpretation by listeners, as well as increased creative output by musicians themselves.\n",
      "Artists portray weed in their music in unique ways — just take a listen to the differences between songs by J. Cole, Rihanna, Arctic Monkeys and Lana del Ray.\n",

      "Despite the negative connotations, marijuana has been a part of the creative process for many musical geniuses because of its function as a psycho-acoustic enhancer.\n",

      "                                                                                                 | 4/28/22 2:10am\n",

      "Marijuana has long been present in music genres like psychedelic rock and reggae, even before the emergence of marijuana usage into the cultural mainstream. Despite historically being stigmatized, weed has progressively become decriminalized and legalized across the country, and recreational usage no longer draws as much scrutiny as it once did. And while marijuana, like any other drug, has the potential for dependency and abuse, it is better known for its euphoric and stimulating psychoactive effects. These effects have inspired musicians throughout history, enhancing their music and creativity. \n",
      "Weed can be first seen in popular music way back in the 1920s, especially in jazz. Legendary trumpeter Louis Armstrong was a staunch aficionado of marijuana’s soothing and creative properties, recording an instrumental track called “Muggles” in 1928, which was named after a slang term for weed. But weed was not mainstream at the time — it is important to note that weed’s association with Black culture and music gave it a negative connotation in society and law enforcement that still persists to this day. \n",
      "Perhaps one of Bob Dylan’s biggest claims to fame besides his own music is introducing John Lennon to cannabis. The Beatles would go on to introduce weed (and psychedelics) into the broader mainstream of white counterculture with subtle references in songs like “Got to Get You in My Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now these things aren't drugs; they just bend your mind a little,\" Dylan said about opium and cannabis in a 1963 Playboy interview. \"I think everybody's mind should be bent once in a while.\"\n",
      "With the popularization of the electric guitar, the effects of spacy guitar pedals birthed psychedelic rock, in which a simple guitar riff could evolve into a web of sonic complexity. This counterculture peaked with the 1967 “Summer of Love” and the landmark 1969 Woodstock Festival headlined by artists like Jimi Hendrix and The Jefferson Airplane who performed psychedelic sets.\n",
      "The influence of psychedelics and cannabis on rock music largely retreated in the 1970s, though marijuana remained a common theme in Caribbean music styles like reggae and dancehall. Beyond his influence on reggae and ska, Bob Marley was one of the most prolific advocates for cannabis of his time. As a Rastafarian, Marley used cannabis as a natural aid for spiritual meditation and religious growth.\n",
      "Cannabis was a recurring theme in the 80s and 90s era of gangster rap, again entrenched in a culture of a marginalized minority demonized by conservatives and president Ronald Reagan’s war on drugs. Snoop Dogg, once a rapper on the streets of Long Beach who turned into a pop culture icon, remains one of the most recognizable figureheads of cannabis consumption.\n",
      "Today, weed’s omnipresence can be seen across the musical spectrum, from down-tempo indie pop to gritty SoundCloud trap. In the past decade, artists as varied as Lana Del Rey’s “High by the Beach”, Bruno Mars’ “Smokin’ out the Window” and Future’s “Drankin n Smokin” have all implicitly or explicitly referenced cannabis usage in their songs. Weed is no longer perceived as belonging to hippie or Black culture — I doubt college students today perceive smoking weed as the act of rebellion it once was. One could even argue weed culture has become mainstream because it has been so commonly adopted by white musicians.\n",
      "It is interesting to compare marijuana’s perception and presence in music to that of other drugs — especially alcohol, a party drug so ubiquitous in media that it is often not treated as a drug. Alcohol also tends to lend itself more to higher-energy music — anecdotally, it pairs better with the monotonic repetitive and driving nature of electronic dance music than spacey psychedelic rock or vibey rhythm and blues. Recurring mentions of drug usage in contemporary hip-hop often pair marijuana with MDMA, cocaine and other drugs, further blurring the distinction with the low potential harm of marijuana. But the accessible psychoactive properties of marijuana also place it as a primary gateway influence of the umbrella of psychedelia: Including genres like acid jazz, chillwave, hypnagogic pop, psychedelic rock, psytrance and trip hop.\n",
      "Given the social stigma against cannabis usage in academic and professional circles, the interplay of weed and music remains largely an unscholarly endeavor. However, there’s a growing body of interdisciplinary research on musicology, neuroscience and psychology.\n",
      "Jörg Fachner, a professor of music, health and the brain at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK, explained the relationship between marijuana and music in an interview with Vice Magazine. \n",
      "“[Marijuana] works like a psycho-acoustic enhancer,” Fachner said. “That means you are more able to absorb, to focus on something, and to have a bit of a broader spectrum. It doesn't change the music; it doesn't change the ear functioning. Obviously it changes the way we perceive ear space in music.”\n",
      "Daniel J. Levitin, music psychologist and professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at McGill University, explained how marijuana changes the brain to enhance the effect of music in his book “The World in Six Songs.”\n",
      "“THC — the active ingredient — is known to stimulate the brain's natural pleasure centers, while also disrupting short-term memory,” Levitin said. “The disruption of short-term memory thrusts listeners into the moment of the music as it unfolds; unable to explicitly keep in mind what has just been played, or to think ahead to what might be played, people stoned on pot tend to hear music from note to note.”\n",
      "In other words, weed allows a listener to solely zone into the music. Compared to other art forms, music is strictly temporal, unfolding with time on a predetermined path. Music is a natural complement to being high — unlike reading a book or watching a movie, you don’t have to consciously rationalize the music. The euphoric sensation lies in our brain’s pattern recognition ability to identify harmonics, melody and rhythm. Weed’s ability to trigger “hyper-priming” — or connecting to seemingly abstract and unrelated concepts — may lead to more creative lyrical interpretation by listeners, as well as increased creative output by musicians themselves.\n",
      "Artists portray weed in their music in unique ways — just take a listen to the differences between songs by J. Cole, Rihanna, Arctic Monkeys and Lana del Ray.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "New Hampshire’s once-in-a-decade congressional redistricting process is currently underway, with Democratic and Republican state lawmakers in disagreement over how to draw representative boundaries.\n",
      "The news comes after the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a proposal on March 17 that would make the first congressional district, currently held by Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., more Republican, and the second congressional district, currently held by Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H., more Democratic. Under the plan, about 25% of New Hampshire voters would switch districts, according to New Hampshire Public Radio. Hanover’s position in the second district would remain unaffected.\n",
      "In response, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, proposed his own map on March 22 that would preserve swing district competitiveness rather than carving out two partisan enclaves. In a letter to state Senate president Chuck Morse and house speaker Sherman Packard, Sununu wrote that his version “keeps our districts competitive, passes the smell test and holds our incumbents accountable so that no one elected official is immune from challengers or constituent services.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In an emailed statement to The Dartmouth, the governor’s press office wrote that Sununu “remains in contact with legislative leaders, has encouraged alternative approaches in addition to the map proposed by him in April and is optimistic that a fair solution will be reached.”\n",
      "New Hampshire congressional maps are required by the New Hampshire Department of State to be finalized by the June 10 filing deadline — the last day congressional candidates are able to enter into a race. As of publication, New Hampshire is one of four states nationally without a finalized congressional map. Republican House member Ross Berry, who represents part of Manchester and Litchfield, said that the deadline is subject to change, should it be necessary.\n",
      "“New Hampshire law allows the Secretary of State to move the filing deadline,” Berry said. “We’re obviously going to try to still make that [deadline].”\n",
      "Government professor and Democratic representative Russell Muirhead, who represents Hanover and Lyme, expressed disappointment with the plan passed by the state legislature. According to Muirhead, less competitive districts will lead to more polarizing candidates, which exacerbates political tribalism.\n",
      "“Safe districts select for extremists because there’s almost no way that in a safe Democratic district, that Democratic candidate can lose, or in a safe Republican district that the Republican representative can lose,” Muirhead said. “The primary electorate can mold the general election, then hold the seat safely. Extremes don’t represent the sensible center of either the American electorate — or the New Hampshire electorate — very effectively.”\n",
      "Though Muirhead said he thought Sununu’s map did not “visually represent” an obvious attempt at gerrymandering, he said he still had reservations with the governor’s proposal.  \n",
      "“I think it still reflects an obvious effort to move Republicans around so that we have less competitive districts,” he said.\n",
      "However, Berry defended the maps passed by the legislature, as he said that his definition of competitive was “based on results.”\n",
      "“So, when they say the current maps are competitive, I just got to call BS on that,” Berry said. “[The House Republicans] were the only ones that produced a competitive map. We produced a map that the Democrats would likely win, and we produced another district where Republicans had a chance.”\n",
      "Over the course of the last redistricting cycle, only one Republican has won a  New Hampshire congressional race, when Republican Frank Guinta represented the first district from 2015 to 2017. Berry said this fact indicated Democrats had won in “90%” of New Hampshire congressional races over the last decade. \n",
      "Without an agreed-upon map, the New Hampshire Supreme Court intervened on April 11, appointing Stanford Law professor Nathaniel Persiley as a “special master” to evaluate redistricting efforts. The move came after former Speaker of the House Terie Norelli, along with other plaintiffs, brought a lawsuit against the Republican legislature’s approved map. \n",
      "Berry said he wished the Court had not involved itself in the redistricting process, which he said was “jumping the gun.” \n",
      "“It’s already a politically fractious process, and I don’t feel that they made it any easier,” Berry said.\n",
      "The redistricting process has energized voters from around the state and across the political spectrum, Muirhead said. As a state representative, Muirhead said he has received considerable feedback from his constituents on the issue.\n",
      "“[My constituents] want maps that pass the common sense test,” Muirhead said. “They just want a fair politics that responds to the common sense interests of voters. They think gerrymandering skews that and distorts it, and I think they’re right.”\n",

      "Noticing the billowing smokestack towering over the southern part of campus and the oil trucks that regularly make deliveries there, I decided to do some research. I discovered that Dartmouth’s heating plant, which has been supplying heat to campus since 1903, uses 3.5 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil each year to heat campus.\n",
      "No. 6 fuel oil is considered one of the dirtiest fuels and is only still in use due to its energy density and low cost. As a result, Dartmouth emits 65,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, making it the largest polluter per student in the Ivy League as of 2013, with over 10  metric tons per student. \n",
      "Earth-warming carbon dioxide is not the only product from the plant; the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services considers Dartmouth a major source of nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. This is completely out of sync with Dartmouth’s values, and I feel that Dartmouth lacks the foresight and urgency necessary to tackle this crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with Dartmouth alumnus William Schlesinger ’72, a distinguished biogeochemist who previously worked as the dean of Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment. Schlesinger was one of the authors of a public letter opposing a wood-burning biomass plant originally planned to replace the existing fossil fuel plant at Dartmouth. Burning wood would have actually increased Dartmouth’s carbon dioxide emissions, so plans for the biomass plant were scrapped in December 2020. Schlesinger said he believes Dartmouth has not taken its sustainable footprint seriously\n",
      "“I think what Dartmouth needs to do is … realize there is not going to be a cheap fix to this,” he said. “If they want to get carbon off their emissions, it’s going to require solar and a big battery system to back it up and/or a pumped-hydro system. This is not going to be a small project, it’s going to cost the equivalent of a new science building or a few new dormitories on campus.”\n",
      "When asked how he would manage Dartmouth’s sustainability going forward, Schlesinger said that he “would charge the Thayer School [of Engineering] and Irving Institute [for Energy and Society] to explore all renewable energy sources available. There is not a better institution in the nation to come up with a better plan than Thayer and Irving working together … When their report comes to the table, there ought to be money to get to work. We really must be carbon-neutral by 2030.” \n",
      "Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management professor of management John Sterman ’77 acknowledged the need for all institutions to find solutions that align with national and global climate targets. Sterman, who also opposed the wood-burning biomass plant, stressed an “integrated design process,” in which the campus is retrofitted to create a unified energy ecosystem, rather than making decisions in a “piecemeal fashion.”\n",
      "This approach aligns with what Dartmouth is doing currently —making campus more energy efficient through building retrofits and changing the piping network from steam to hot water. The piping project will cost $200 to$400 million, take 10 years to complete and make campus 23% more energy efficient, according to the director of sustainability Rosi Kerr. Increased energy efficiency will mean an overall decreased energy demand for whatever renewable energy system replaces the power plant, allowing for an easier and more affordable transition.\n",
      "These energy-efficient measures require swing space for residents, research space and classrooms. Dartmouth is experiencing an undergraduate housing crisis so this swing space is nowhere to be found. The retrofitting of Dartmouth Hall has taken two years and is still ongoing, and the hot water system likely will not be completed until 2030.\n",
      "Sterman also stressed that energy transitions have many ancillary benefits. For example, energy-efficient buildings are more comfortable and quieter due to increased insulation and better windows. Additionally, these projects create jobs and lead to the better health of those working in the buildings. Rather than being framed as a cost, Sterman stressed that the College should view these changes as an “investment” that protects the itself from volatile fossil fuel prices, enhances the reputation of the school, pays for itself in significantly reduced energy and heating costs and, above all, is aligned with the health and well-being of the planet.\n",
      "On Earth Day in 2017, Dartmouth committed to a wide-ranging set of sustainability goals. This included a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from campus operations by 50% by 2025 and 80% by 2050 and having Dartmouth be supplied with 50% renewable energy by 2025 and 100% by 2050. This was contingent on the now-scrapped idea of building a biomass plant. Dartmouth has since looked into various renewable energy sources but has been radio silent on the actual technologies and strategies it is pursuing. Dartmouth should consider air-source and geothermal heat pumps that can run on clean electricity as they now work in sub-zero climates. There is also plenty of fallow farmland in New Hampshire and Vermont suitable for large-scale solar farms. Additionally, most East Coast states are installing offshore wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean for their power needs. Power from offshore turbines could be fed into the grid at the Seabrook nuclear power plant on the New Hampshire coastline. New Hampshire has favorable topography to build pumped hydroelectric storage facilities to store this solar and wind power.\n",
      "During Earth Day this year, Dartmouth updated campus on its sustainability initiatives. It was my sincere hope going into these announcements that the College would lay out a specific path to sharp emissions reductions. Ultimately, College president Phil Hanlon emailed the student body, announcing — without any supporting data — that Dartmouth’s greenhouse gas emissions had declined 30% from the 2010 baselines, which meant we were closer to the 2025 goal of 50% emissions reduction. 30% efficiency in 12 years is noteworthy, but will it be possible for Dartmouth to reduce emissions by another 20% in three years? I am not so sure. \n",
      "In a significant step forward, Dartmouth’s Board of Trustees agreed in March 2021 on an infrastructure renewal fund. Normally, 5% of the endowment is used to fund the operating budget, and under this new policy this percentage would increase. The IRF would use a percentage of this bolstered operating budget to provide funds for new residential buildings and to make buildings more sustainable and energy-efficient.\n",
      "However, it felt like we took two steps backward at the Earth Day conference when the panel of College administrators  spoke about the annual capital expenditures necessary to maintain Dartmouth’s standing as a world-class educational institution: investing in cutting-edge research, hiring brilliant professors and constructing new buildings, in addition to the energy transition. Concerning the sustainable transition, the panelists said, “We don’t have enough money to do everything we need to across all these dimensions.”\n",
      "Additionally, the panelists mentioned many of the challenges of the energy transition at Dartmouth, including that over 60% of the buildings on campus would have to be totally renovated to meet sustainability standards, and over 90% would need some work done. Given the speed of the construction project at Dartmouth Hall, it is unclear if this can be done in a timely manner. There was also little discussion about specific plans to meet stated goals. Dartmouth currently has a goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. While there was talk of increasing efficiency, there was no mention of any concrete plans or a timeline for the transition to renewable energy — the most crucial aspect for reaching that reduction objective. Five years after Dartmouth set its sustainability goals, it feels like no work has been done. There are plans for a strategic review of Dartmouth’s sustainability goals with updated recommendations in the fall of 2022. I truly hope these are more specific than the Earth Day conference and reflect the situation’s urgency.\n",
      "Dartmouth is largely defined by its external environment. Being surrounded by forests, rivers, lakes and mountains fosters much of the experience of living and studying here. Rather than being a laggard, Dartmouth must fully embrace its motto, Vox clamantis in deserto — “a lone voice crying out in the wilderness.” The biblical verse refers to the call to speak the truth even if you are not being heard. We must be the lone voice crying out in the wilderness for change, to protect the nature that defines our very being. \n",

      "Prestigious universities, such as Dartmouth and its peer institutions, have grown too comfortable with hoarding their billions in endowments as a status symbol, preventing students from benefiting from even the fraction it would take to improve campus facilities and programs. Just last year, the College boasted a 46.5% year-over-year return on its endowment, and instituted a few limited financial changes, including increasing student workers’ hourly minimum wage by $3.75 and eliminating an expected parent contribution in financial aid calculations. While these changes are commendable, institutions like Dartmouth continue to withhold funds from being used more directly for improving the academic and personal lives of their students. It’s past time for the federal government to step in with a stick and tax college endowments. \n",
      "As concentrations of immense wealth, university endowments have the potential to better support students. As the Tax Policy Center points out, public and private university endowments in America account for $500 billion, and just 23 universities hold 50% of this. Dartmouth itself ranks number 19 in American university endowments. On top of this, colleges invest their endowments in the stock market, allowing their assets to accrue interest tax-free. \n",
      "Currently, college endowments are minimally taxed. As 501(c)(3) nonprofits, most private universities are naturally exempt from paying taxes. Some legislative efforts have attempted to address this oversight, such as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that subjected a small number of wealthy universities within a certain endowment threshold to a 1.4% tax. However, House Democrats are now advocating against the Trump-era policy, aiming to lift the tax on around 40 of the nation’s wealthiest colleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Advocates against taxing endowments — including universities themselves — argue that universities are nonprofits that advance a socially beneficial cause, and this fact in itself should leave them exempt from taxation. This point is well noted, but colleges fail in this mission of educating and providing resources for students when they hoard their endowments. In order to best support students, colleges must be incentivized to spend on them. And taxation need not be the only solution — others attentive to the issue of university wealth hoarding have advocated for legislation requiring institutions to spend a certain percentage of their endowments annually. This solution would make the treatment of universities more akin to that of private foundations, as opposed to nonprofits. It also incentivizes a direct transfer of endowment wealth to student-focused programs and initiatives.\n",
      "Universities are hesitant to spend their endowment funds for several reasons. Centrally, a college’s endowment is less of a “piggy bank” or pool of readily usable funds and more of a fund governed by extensive restrictions and earmarks for specific programs. Institutions also value the long-term growth of their endowments, putting significant financial efforts into how they invest it and withdrawing from these endowments limits their return on these investments. Typically, a college only spends between 4 and 5% percent of its endowment each year. Finally, an unspoken reason for hesitancy to spend endowments is the correlation between university endowments and rankings — in the race among top universities to boost rankings, they likely feel pressure to boast greater endowment figures. All of these perverse incentives can be mitigated with a federal policy on taxing endowments, pushing colleges to spend them on students.\n",
      "Pushing colleges to spend their endowments may also be a creative way to address economic inequities. As several economic studies have found, blanket student loan forgiveness, like the plan proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is actually a regressive policy, disproportionately benefiting the college-educated upper-middle class. A novel set of education policies — backed by a bipartisan cohort in Congress — includes taxing endowments and actually increases support for meriting students from less privileged backgrounds. \n",
      "Giving universities the nudge on their endowments would also mitigate the issue that University of California Irvine professor Victor Fleischer calls “the symbiotic relationship between university endowments and the world of hedge funds and private equity funds.” Ivy League institutions like Yale, Harvard and Princeton dole out hundreds of millions of dollars to private equity fund managers who invest endowment money. For these institutions, their spending on fund managers actually surpasses their spending on programs for students, including “tuition assistance, fellowships and prizes.” Hedge fund and private equity fund managers, in turn, give large donations to these wealthy universities. While taxing endowments or requiring universities to spend a certain share of them would not entirely eliminate university ties to other rich and powerful institutions, it would at least reduce the issue and put students at the forefront. \n",
      "As it stands, students miss out on countless academic and personal opportunities as a result of these policies, which undermines the supposed aims of these institutions. It is high time for these universities to be forced to place their greed aside and recommit themselves to their students. In short, it’s time to tax university endowments. \n",

      "Option one: I awake to sunlight slipping in through the bottom of my green Dartmouth shade. The sound of birds chirping drifts into my ears, and even though my sleepy eyes urge me back to sleep, I can’t help but rise to meet the day. As I step outside my dorm, squinting to adjust to the light, the sun’s warmth tingles down my arms. It just feels like it’s going to be a good day. Even if I have to sit through an hour of dry math lecturing, it seems like nothing can go wrong. \n",
      "Option two: I wake up to rain thudding against my glass window. It’s dark and dreary. There is no sunlight streaming in and no birds chirping outside. I reach over and check the time on my phone, only to discover that I have a mere twenty minutes until my 10. Ugh. All I want is to let the sound of falling water coax my anxious brain back to sleep. But I can’t. I have a midterm in a week. So I begrudgingly get dressed and put on that raincoat with the hood that drapes over my eyes. Vision somewhat obscured, I walk outside my dorm as rain pours off the gutter up above. Splash — my right foot lands in a massive puddle. Damn. Now my shoes are wet. I slowly trudge to class, weaving around puddles that seem to have sprouted out of nowhere, yearning to return to the coziness of my bed. Instead, I have to deal with the stupid rain. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I may have tweaked those two versions with a bit of creative license, but let’s face it: Sunny days are simply better. Especially after my first real Dartmouth winter — and a truly shocking snowfall on my first day of spring term — these recent warm spring days have felt like magic. There’s a possibility in the air, a newness of life — to put it simply, the vibes are immaculate. Of course, not every sunny day is perfect. There have been many beautiful days where I felt sad and overwhelmed, or felt some innate anxiety to take advantage of every moment, even if there was nothing to do. But even so, on the whole, I can conclude with certainty that I feel happier on sunny days than dreary ones. \n",
      "So why are we so inclined to sunshine? Science has a lot to do with it. In 2011, a study found that people interviewed on exceptionally sunny days report significantly higher levels of life satisfaction than people who were interviewed on days with “ordinary” weather. In 2013, Canadian researchers showed a strong correlation between a lack of Vitamin D and depression, suggesting that the “sunshine vitamin” really does play a role in our mental health. And let’s not forget about seasonal affective disorder , that cruel beast that sneaks up on us every winter. Despite skiing and frozen ponds and hot chocolate, the fact that the sun disappeared at 4:30 everyday slowly took its toll on me this winter. I simply felt worse without the sun. But life doesn’t have to be like that, right?\n",
      "I remember being shocked to hear that one of my friends from L.A. had never shoveled a driveway before. I looked at him with a strange mix of confusion, jealousy and pity — I mean, how have you never shoveled a driveway? But then again, part of me wondered what it would be like to live in California. Sure, it’s not perfect weather all the time, but even as I write this article, the weather report for the week doesn’t list a single day below 65 degrees in L.A., with no chance of precipitation. What would it be like to live somewhere with exceptional weather, to go to a school like UCLA where “bad weather” means 55 degrees with a chance of light afternoon showers? I think we all dream of a life of perfect weather.\n",
      "But we don’t have it. And even in California, it doesn’t exist. So why do we let the weather affect our mood? Why do we give weight to something so far out of our control that many have attributed it to the mood swings of Gods above? If there’s nothing we can do about something, why let it control us? \n",
      "The truth is, I do it all the time, and not just about the weather. I let a friend’s playful smirk trigger my anxiety into a spiral over whether they like me or not — and when I ask them if everything is okay later, they look at me like I’m crazy. I let a comment on my paper from a professor I barely know become a massive part of my self-image for the week. I let the menu at Foco change how I feel about the whole day. Isn’t that ridiculous? After suffering through the pandemic and finally acknowledging my mental health despite years of pithy boomer expressions running through my head (“You’re not sad, Street. You’re just not working hard enough”), at a certain point it just hit me. Why was I letting the uncontrollable control me? Why was I letting bad weather affect my life so drastically? \n",
      "When I think back on the happiest moments of my life, many of those memories don’t take place on a perfectly sunny day. I remember dancing in puddles with my family outside of my childhood home during a torrential downpour, singing and laughing hysterically. We didn’t care about the rain. I didn’t care that my clothes were soaked or that my feet were starting to prune. I was only focused on trying to duck out of the way while my dad splashed me and my sister with a bucket. I also remember playing soccer in a random park with my brother and two Nepalese men who barely spoke English. Rain was pouring down — hair so wet that droplets flew off everytime I spun around — and yet all four of us, who could barely communicate with each other, ran around that field like little kids, giggling when our clothes became stained with mud. \n",
      "There’s something wonderful about embracing the rain. Of course, I am still grateful for those days when the sun peeks its head out from behind the clouds. There’s nothing I love more than an afternoon spent lounging on the Green or a hike up Balch Hill to a sun-soaked meadow. But on days when that doesn’t happen, and those dark clouds circle around Baker tower, there’s no use clinging on to some idealized version of the weather. Why not embrace the rain? Why not get out of bed and walk out into the world — even if I might step in the odd puddle along the way.\n",

But I can’t. I have a midterm in a week. So I begrudgingly get dressed and put on that raincoat with the hood that drapes over my eyes. Vision somewhat obscured, I walk outside my dorm as rain pours off the gutter up above. Splash — my right foot lands in a massive puddle. Damn. Now my shoes are wet. I slowly trudge to class, weaving around puddles that seem to have sprouted out of nowhere, yearning to return to the coziness of my bed. Instead, I have to deal with the stupid rain. \n",

      "I may have tweaked those two versions with a bit of creative license, but let’s face it: Sunny days are simply better. Especially after my first real Dartmouth winter — and a truly shocking snowfall on my first day of spring term — these recent warm spring days have felt like magic. There’s a possibility in the air, a newness of life — to put it simply, the vibes are immaculate. Of course, not every sunny day is perfect. There have been many beautiful days where I felt sad and overwhelmed, or felt some innate anxiety to take advantage of every moment, even if there was nothing to do. But even so, on the whole, I can conclude with certainty that I feel happier on sunny days than dreary ones. \n",
      "So why are we so inclined to sunshine? Science has a lot to do with it. In 2011, a study found that people interviewed on exceptionally sunny days report significantly higher levels of life satisfaction than people who were interviewed on days with “ordinary” weather. In 2013, Canadian researchers showed a strong correlation between a lack of Vitamin D and depression, suggesting that the “sunshine vitamin” really does play a role in our mental health. And let’s not forget about seasonal affective disorder , that cruel beast that sneaks up on us every winter. Despite skiing and frozen ponds and hot chocolate, the fact that the sun disappeared at 4:30 everyday slowly took its toll on me this winter. I simply felt worse without the sun. But life doesn’t have to be like that, right?\n",
      "I remember being shocked to hear that one of my friends from L.A. had never shoveled a driveway before. I looked at him with a strange mix of confusion, jealousy and pity — I mean, how have you never shoveled a driveway? But then again, part of me wondered what it would be like to live in California. Sure, it’s not perfect weather all the time, but even as I write this article, the weather report for the week doesn’t list a single day below 65 degrees in L.A., with no chance of precipitation. What would it be like to live somewhere with exceptional weather, to go to a school like UCLA where “bad weather” means 55 degrees with a chance of light afternoon showers? I think we all dream of a life of perfect weather.\n",
      "But we don’t have it. And even in California, it doesn’t exist. So why do we let the weather affect our mood? Why do we give weight to something so far out of our control that many have attributed it to the mood swings of Gods above? If there’s nothing we can do about something, why let it control us? \n",
      "The truth is, I do it all the time, and not just about the weather. I let a friend’s playful smirk trigger my anxiety into a spiral over whether they like me or not — and when I ask them if everything is okay later, they look at me like I’m crazy. I let a comment on my paper from a professor I barely know become a massive part of my self-image for the week. I let the menu at Foco change how I feel about the whole day. Isn’t that ridiculous? After suffering through the pandemic and finally acknowledging my mental health despite years of pithy boomer expressions running through my head (“You’re not sad, Street. You’re just not working hard enough”), at a certain point it just hit me. Why was I letting the uncontrollable control me? Why was I letting bad weather affect my life so drastically? \n",
      "When I think back on the happiest moments of my life, many of those memories don’t take place on a perfectly sunny day. I remember dancing in puddles with my family outside of my childhood home during a torrential downpour, singing and laughing hysterically. We didn’t care about the rain. I didn’t care that my clothes were soaked or that my feet were starting to prune. I was only focused on trying to duck out of the way while my dad splashed me and my sister with a bucket. I also remember playing soccer in a random park with my brother and two Nepalese men who barely spoke English. Rain was pouring down — hair so wet that droplets flew off everytime I spun around — and yet all four of us, who could barely communicate with each other, ran around that field like little kids, giggling when our clothes became stained with mud. \n",
      "There’s something wonderful about embracing the rain. Of course, I am still grateful for those days when the sun peeks its head out from behind the clouds. There’s nothing I love more than an afternoon spent lounging on the Green or a hike up Balch Hill to a sun-soaked meadow. But on days when that doesn’t happen, and those dark clouds circle around Baker tower, there’s no use clinging on to some idealized version of the weather. Why not embrace the rain? Why not get out of bed and walk out into the world — even if I might step in the odd puddle along the way.\n",

      "I have been completely deceived.\n",
      "My week three was positively luxurious. With two of my classes having temporarily moved online, I spent my afternoons lounging on the Green, doing my readings while laying back on a picnic blanket and enjoying the bright blue skies. While it was concerning that I now considered 60 degrees to be tanning weather, I relished the fact that I could (finally) wear shorts again. It was looking like spring had finally sprung — and with it any vestiges of winter depression had disappeared.\n",
      "For most of the week I continued under these delusions of leisurely frolicking, excited for the summery weeks to come. So I was appalled when I walked out of my building on an otherwise nondescript Saturday morning to find that not only had the temperature returned to a chilly 30  degrees, but there was actually snow falling from the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like this past week was a dreary return to pre-spring break weather, but my hours spent relaxing on the Green allowed me to take notice of my fellow Dartmouth students’ outfits. Amidst my readings and random dog sightings around campus, many of us sprung at the opportunity to wear something a little different. While some people jumped at the chance to wear short sleeves, others clung to their down parkas. And when the temperature dipped back down, I saw many who continued to wear their shorts and flip-flops, maybe as an act of defiance. \n",
      "There is, of course, that time-worn classic: The guy who, regardless of temperature, can always be spotted sporting flip-flops as if it were the middle of July. On one morning walk to Foco, I asked Zach Ojakli ’25 about his choice to wear shorts despite the 40-degree weather. \n",
      "Despite being from outside Washington D.C., Ojakli didn’t seem to be bothered by the chilly morning. \n",
      "He commented that “after that long winter, everyone is just trying to take advantage of the warm weather as soon as they can, so I’m definitely doing that too.” Unfazed by the chilly morning, Ojakli held out hope that the afternoon would be a little warmer.\n",
      "He said that his clothing “might be a little unseasonal in the morning, but not in the afternoon. That’s just how Hanover weather works.” \n",
      "Others, like Cooper Whalen ’25, took an even more extreme position on the cold-weather shorts debate. Being from Vermont, Whalen seemed to have no problem wearing flip-flops even on a cloudy and windy morning. \n",
      "“Basically anything above 50 degrees is a justification to wear shorts,” Whalen said. \n",
      "Sadly, as the temperature took a turn for the worse this week, even the most steadfast flip-flop wearers began to disappear, so I instead got an interesting look at some students’ cooler weather pieces. \n",
      "On one sunny but chilly day, I spotted Sam Ford ’23 sporting a shearling leather jacket. While Ford said it wasn’t exactly a springtime getup, she said it made the perfect “cozy outfit, which is good on days like today.” Ford added that she was inspired by the movie “The Devil Wears Prada,” where a similar jacket is featured. \n",
      "“I used to watch that movie when I was younger, so I wanted a jacket like this. I had a hard time finding one and then I found this vegan leather one that was perfect,” Ford said. \n",
      "Ford wasn’t the only student I interviewed who put quite a bit of thought into her outfit. Rebecca Xie Tu’23 caught my eye in a colorful cardigan with tufted flowers. Xie lamented our current transitional phase of spring, which is “still too cold for the spring ’fit,” but said that her cardigan provided the perfect “texture and pop of color.” \n",
      "Xie said that the eye-catching cardigan was pre-owned, and shared that her passion for sustainable fashion influences the way she buys her clothes.\n",
      "“I love Poshmark and Depop,” Xie said. “I usually do keywords, like ‘cardigan,’ and I just find something I like.” \n",
      "The outfits I spotted around campus certainly spanned the spectrum from nonchalant shorts-wearers to sustainability aficionados. Often, people’s fashion choices meant a lot more than just the clothes they were wearing — whether it was a childhood memory like Ford’s or an environmentally conscious choice like Xie’s. Even the stubborn flip-flop wearers seemed to be proving their mettle against the frigid New Hampshire mornings. \n",
      "My foray into others’ fashion showed me that there’s usually some intentionality, whether a lot or a little, behind what people choose to wear. Even though I dreaded walking to class on yet another dreary day, seeing people’s colorful choices — and the occasional flip-flops guy — made my day just a little brighter.\n",

      "                                                                                                 | 4/27/22 2:20am\n",

      "I was in that fuzzy space between sleeping and waking when I remembered that I couldn’t remember. The trash can beside the bed, the backwards t-shirt, the taste of frat in my mouth. Nice. Within minutes I was out the door, sneakers slamming hard against the cracked sidewalks. There was a part of me that desired some sort of physical undoing, like the act of sweating would somehow rid me of my poor decisions from the night before. I ran four miles that morning and jumped into the Connecticut with all my clothes on, probably still half-drunk. Soggy and confused, I returned to my room with the lyric line of “Why the fuck did I just do that?” reverberating around the inside of my skull. I didn’t know the answer to my own question, but I suspected that it had something to do with what I couldn’t process, what I didn’t want to sit in. Waking up to the taste of stale tequila on your tongue and foreign bruises all down your body from drunken falls makes for a depressing morning.\n",
      "I’ve blacked out twice in my life. The first time was when I was 15 and tried hard alcohol for the first time, completely unaware of my limits or how the sharp, clear liquid in a pretty bottle could magically erase an entire night’s memory. The second time was on a random night during fall 2021, and there was literally no rhyme or reason to why it happened. I had gone way too hard for no good reason, but I soon became aware of the universality of this experience for college students, however perplexing and unappealing it seems to the non-drinker and drinker alike.\n",
      "I think about alcohol a lot, perhaps because I have some personal stake in the matter. My family has a history of alcoholism, and just this past summer, someone within my immediate family ended up in the ICU because of it. I wonder why we’re so much worse than our parents were, why beer isn’t enough, why we don’t stop after one, two, even three blackouts, why it’s become so commonplace to drink yourself to regurgitation or unconsciousness. The fact that men’s rush culture encourages knocking back as much alcohol as you can without puking, the fact that I know only the intoxicated versions of too many people here, the fact that going out isn’t fun unless you’re drunk doesn’t sit well with me — like too many Keystones on an empty stomach. And there’s hardly ever a compelling justification for any of it. We get smashed just to say we got smashed, then limp back to our flimsy college-grade mattresses to sleep off the poison in our bodies before we rise for another round of overachieving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve run through the possible reasons for our generation’s appalling relationship with alcohol. Do we drink to forget or remember? To feel something or nothing at all? Is it panic? Are we afraid that we’ve lost too much time to the pandemic to not squeeze all the wild nights of our youth into four years of binge drinking? Is what we really crave when we drink the brave, bold versions of ourselves that exist only in the context of intoxication? I mean, what else is there to do in the middle of nowhere?\n",
      "I’d love to believe in our parents’ romantic notion that we do it because it makes us look cool. It certainly makes for a nice image: The attractive Dartmouth partiers, clad in seersucker and silk, lapping magic liquid from crystal glasses and getting buzzed enough to actually understand Kant. But this absurd romanticisation doesn’t usually withstand the reality of Dartmouth pregames, with their vodka-crans in Nalgenes, sneakers coated in the elusive film of frat basement and the ever-present conviction that the night will end in either boredom or vomit. \n",
      "There is some truth to all of these possibilities, I suppose. For me, drinking masks the disappointment of Dartmouth’s social scene, makes me far more ballsy with my frat-boy banter (and I’ll admit that all the boys I’ve met here seem far more interesting when I’m under the influence) and suspends me in a world that doesn’t seem to require anything of me. The lack of responsibility, is that it? Perhaps we’re so anxious about entering the real world that we’ve resorted to pumping ourselves full of toxins to temporarily alleviate the pressure of what’s to come.\n",
      "Whatever the reason — and we all have our reasons — it’s certainly worth thinking about, lest we forget the real-life dangers that accompany the throat burn of a shot or the intolerable, fruity carbonation of a White Claw Surge. Though my past behavior bars me from taking any moral high ground, I believe it’s worth giving more critical attention to why we drink and the implications of having a college culture obsessed with the altered state of intoxication.\n",

      "“five seconds flat” features heart-wrenching lyrics and beautiful production as it chronologically captures heartbreak and finding a new beginning. Lizzy McAlpine’s musical style has been described as a cross between folk-pop and alternative indie, with her songwriting shining through the instrumentals. McAlpine’s new work was well anticipated, with five singles released in the six months leading up to the album. She gained popularity through social media and her first album, “Give Me A Minute.” Her second album, “five seconds flat,” came out on April 8 along with a 29-minute short film that was released the next day. \n",
      "The album follows a very cohesive narrative, sculpted by the order and structure of the album. Upon release, McAlpine wrote on Instagram, “i really put a lot of work into making sure that the track list was in the right order and the story that it told was cohesive so i would urge you to listen through the first time in order.”  “five seconds flat” is a narrative masterpiece, artfully telling a story of love and loss with emotional songs that leave the listeners aching. McAlpine proves her ability to structure a story with the album, but faults arise with the incohesive vision of the short film.  \n",
      "“doomsday” is the first single and opening track, which forshadows the rest of the album beautifully. The track and music video have some of the most meaningful imagery with the chorus lyrics “it's only the death of me,” accompanied by McAlpine’s artistic funeral scene. Despite this metaphorical death at the hands of her ex, she is slightly optimistic with the lyrics: “I feel more free than I have in years / six feet in the ground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the singles, my personal favorites from the album have to be “ceilings,” “an ego thing” and “chemtrails.” “ceilings” builds on the energy of past McAlpine songs that are longtime favorites of mine, with powerful heartfelt lyrics, her peaceful soft voice and warm acoustic guitar accompaniment.\n",
      "“chemtrails” is a beautiful tribute to McAlpine’s late father, capturing a timeless grief. Accompanied by a simple piano chord, gut-wrenching lyrics keep this song in the forefront of my mind. The end of the song incorporates audio from a childhood video with McAlpine’s father. “chemtrails” parallels McAlpine’s 2020 song “Headstones and Land Mines,” which follows the grief caused by the pandemic and the loss of her father. “chemtrails” shows difficult growth  with the melancholic lyric, “It's so hard to believe, but right now, I feel stable.” \n",
      "“an ego thing” has a new energy that I haven’t heard in McAlpine’s music before. With more experimental accompaniment and strong beats, the song strays from McAlpine’s signature songwriter sound. Continuing this versatility, “orange show speedway,” is a powerful finale to the album. It is an upbeat, danceable song that slows down in the final moments. Lyrics like “My best friends are with me and I feel okay / The last time I was here, I was eighteen,” show how she has changed over the last three years. She beautifully captures starting over while acknowledging, but not being limited by, memories of the past. \n",
      "The short film, written by McAlpine, illustrates a story of a high school breakup, a rebound and the recovery process of losing a relationship, accompanied by some of the songs from the album. Several allusions to  locations from earlier songs come back with McAlpine singing lines from “hate to be lame,” tying together the narrative of the film. Finally, the end credit song is “orange show speedway,” which is fitting because it’s the final song of the album and captures coming back after loss. \n",
      "Throughout the film, McAlpine uses skeleton makeup to show who is hollowed by the romance. With the first lover, McAlpine dons the skeleton makeup several times. Then, with the second lover, the new man wears skeleton makeup, showing that he is more invested in the relationship than she is. \n",
      "While I love that more musical artists are experimenting with short films, McAlpine’s unfortunately falls short. At 29 minutes, the film is too long and says too little. The short film uses the entire music videos for singles “doomsday,” “erase me,” “all my ghosts,” “reckless driving” and “hate to be lame.” This makes the overall film feel like a compilation of music videos, drowning out the dialogue and scenes. \n",
      "At first, I didn’t know why I didn’t like McAlpine’s short film as much as I wanted to. However, when I saw a TikTok advertisement for the short film, I realized what it was: The film has beautiful storytelling and imagery, but the compilation of music videos takes away from it. The TikTok featured one of the scenes with dialogue, with an instrumental version of what sounds like “hate to be lame” and “reckless driving” overlaying the dialogue and visual cuts of various scenes from the film. This minute-long video captured the feeling that I hoped the short film would have, with the music being an element to the film, not the feature.\n",
      "McAlpine has collaborated with many artists, both on the album and in the past — she was on tour with dodie just before the release of “five seconds flat.” Since the album’s release, McAlpine’s fame has continued to grow, even joining FINNEAS at Coachella. McAlpine also announced her first headline tour for “five seconds flat” on April 7, the day before the album was released. By April 14, all but four shows had sold out. McAlpine is showing her ability to have success with full length albums, with both “Give Me A Minute” and “five seconds flat” achieving great success with their lyrical ingenuity — despite her new artist status. “five seconds flat” elevates her previous work and highlights McAlpine’s wonderful storytelling and unique ability to create a cohesive album. \n",

      "From April 13 until May 15, Northern Stage theater company is performing “Monty Python’s Spamalot” — a musical comedy adaptation of the beloved movie “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” — as part of its 2021-2022 season. The tale is a parody of King Arthur’s quest to find the Holy Grail, featuring nods to the history of musical theater and feel-good ballads. In the play, King Arthur and his knights are sent on a mission by the elusive Lady of the Lake to first find the Holy Grail, and then to put on a Broadway show.\n",
      "Stacia Nugent ’23 and Sophia Serpas ’24 performed in the ensemble while Betty Faul-Welfare ’23 worked on the show’s lighting design with the theater department chair Dan J. Kotlowitz. Theater professor Carol Dunne directed the show and also serves as producing artistic director of Northern Stage. \n",
      "“Spamalot” is famously one of the silliest shows in musical theater, bringing the humorous energy of Monty Python onto the stage. The setting changes often, ranging from the castles of France to Camelot reimagined as Las Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“This spectacular and very silly show is more than just catchy — it is a Valentine to everything we love about musical theater,” Dunne wrote  in a statement from the show’s program. “We’ve got tap dancers for you, and ninjas and love songs and winks to the history of musical theater.”\n",
      "Nugent, who is performing in the show with professionals as part of her experiential learning “e-term” program, plays multiple characters in the ensemble. \n",
      "“My roles range from being a Monk to a Knight of Ni,” Nugent said. “Due to this, I have quite a few quick changes, which means I have to get creative. If you see a bunch of religious monks walking around with Bibles in hand, know that at least one of them is wearing full Camelot Turret Girl attire underneath.”\n",
      "The constant location shifts are one of the driving factors of the decisions of the lighting design. Kotlowitz emphasized that the lighting makes the setting shifts between Camelot and Finland clear for the audience. \n",
      "“You’re in the middle of a King Arthur play and then suddenly they break into Fiddler on the Roof,” Kotlowitz said. “The lighting sort of helps to make those transitions visual. There are moments when suddenly you’re in a disco, and playing with those different styles has been rewarding.” \n",
      "While “Spamalot” is a silly show by nature, the professional setting of Northern Stage demands a seriousness and decorum when performing with the cast. Nugent and Serpas both reflected on the professionalism of their e-term experience.\n",
      "“This is my first full production that’s in person since the pandemic started,” Serpas said.  “Additionally, it’s been really cool to work alongside professional actors and get a glimpse into how people make this their career.”\n",
      "Nugent specified that the unconventionality of the show is aiding her growth as an artist.\n",
      "“Sure, ‘Spamalot’ is a silly show that definitely doesn’t take itself seriously, but I’ve observed that in order to believably live in its silliness, I have to not only be comfortable with who I am but become willing to share it all without fear of judgment or condemnation — no matter how weird or unconventional it may seem according to societal standards,” Nugent said. \n",
      "However, Nugent added that the e-term has been physically and mentally challenging as well, noting sometimes feeling inadequate when surrounded by such accomplished actors.  \n",
      "“As I watch my beautiful castmates sing melodiously and dance rhythmically on the stage, it’s hard not to be amazed,” Nugent said. “But whenever I find myself sharing the stage with these professionals, I feel like, well, an impostor.

      "The musical is filled with nods to the canon of musical theater: Joseph Stein’s “Fiddler on the Roof,” Stephen Sondheim’s “Company” and references to famous Broadway divas like Liza Minnelli. In Act 2, the Lady of the Lake, a parody of Guenevere portrayed by Michelle Beth Herman, laments “Whatever Happened to my Part,” playing into the trope of Minnelli, a notorious prima donna. She complains about the “producers” and belts longingly into the audience. At one point, the stage managers of the show make an appearance and Herman criticizes them, playing up the trope of the “difficult” Broadway diva. \n",
      "“One of my favorite parts about the show is how it’s a caricature of the culture of theater and the canonical works of what we deem like American musical theater,” Kotlowitz said. “I liked that we got to kind of make fun of ourselves in this way. It’s a self-effacing but joyful kind of work.” \n",
      "The musical attempts to capture the many sub-communities within theater itself. Songs like “His Name is ‘Lancelot’” and “You Won’t Succeed on Broadway” respectively allude to the robust LGBTQ+ and Jewish artistic communities in theater. \n",
      "“There are a lot of aspects of theater that the show touches on — the people who have historically contributed to it and the general working environment of musical theater,” Kotlowitz said. \n",
      "While addressing theater culture, performers also made jokes relevant to inhabitants of the Upper Valley. During the show, the cast picked an audience member to find the Holy Grail. King Arthur, played by Jonas Cohen, asked for the audience member’s name and said that he is part of the “good people of the Upper Valley, next to Bernie Sanders and Ben and Jerry.” \n",
      "More than anything, the performers’ humor in “Spamalot” created an energetic and lively atmosphere. The Northern Stage audience was cracking up at almost every joke and lighting shift. \n",
      "“It’s impossible to work on ‘Spamalot’ and not end up with ‘Always look on the bright side of life’ stuck in your head,” Dunne said, referencing one of the show’s recurring songs. \n",
      "With triple-threat performers, Monty Python’s humor, a little bit of satire and the intimate space of the Northern Stage theater company, “Spamalot” managed to poke fun at musical theater, retell the tale of the Holy Grail with a Broadway twist and bring joy to an Upper Valley audience.\n",

      "                                                                                                 | 4/28/22 4:00am\n",

      "Noticing the billowing smokestack towering over the southern part of campus and the oil trucks that regularly make deliveries there, I decided to do some research. I discovered that Dartmouth’s heating plant, which has been supplying heat to campus since 1903, uses 3.5 million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil each year to heat campus.\n",
      "No. 6 fuel oil is considered one of the dirtiest fuels and is only still in use due to its energy density and low cost. As a result, Dartmouth emits 65,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, making it the largest polluter per student in the Ivy League as of 2013, with over 10  metric tons per student. \n",
      "Earth-warming carbon dioxide is not the only product from the plant; the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services considers Dartmouth a major source of nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. This is completely out of sync with Dartmouth’s values, and I feel that Dartmouth lacks the foresight and urgency necessary to tackle this crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke with Dartmouth alumnus William Schlesinger ’72, a distinguished biogeochemist who previously worked as the dean of Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment. Schlesinger was one of the authors of a public letter opposing a wood-burning biomass plant originally planned to replace the existing fossil fuel plant at Dartmouth. Burning wood would have actually increased Dartmouth’s carbon dioxide emissions, so plans for the biomass plant were scrapped in December 2020. Schlesinger said he believes Dartmouth has not taken its sustainable footprint seriously\n",
      "“I think what Dartmouth needs to do is … realize there is not going to be a cheap fix to this,” he said. “If they want to get carbon off their emissions, it’s going to require solar and a big battery system to back it up and/or a pumped-hydro system. This is not going to be a small project, it’s going to cost the equivalent of a new science building or a few new dormitories on campus.”\n",
      "When asked how he would manage Dartmouth’s sustainability going forward, Schlesinger said that he “would charge the Thayer School [of Engineering] and Irving Institute [for Energy and Society] to explore all renewable energy sources available. There is not a better institution in the nation to come up with a better plan than Thayer and Irving working together … When their report comes to the table, there ought to be money to get to work. We really must be carbon-neutral by 2030.” \n",
      "Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management professor of management John Sterman ’77 acknowledged the need for all institutions to find solutions that align with national and global climate targets. Sterman, who also opposed the wood-burning biomass plant, stressed an “integrated design process,” in which the campus is retrofitted to create a unified energy ecosystem, rather than making decisions in a “piecemeal fashion.”\n",
      "This approach aligns with what Dartmouth is doing currently —making campus more energy efficient through building retrofits and changing the piping network from steam to hot water. The piping project will cost $200 to$400 million, take 10 years to complete and make campus 23% more energy efficient, according to the director of sustainability Rosi Kerr. Increased energy efficiency will mean an overall decreased energy demand for whatever renewable energy system replaces the power plant, allowing for an easier and more affordable transition.\n",
      "These energy-efficient measures require swing space for residents, research space and classrooms. Dartmouth is experiencing an undergraduate housing crisis so this swing space is nowhere to be found. The retrofitting of Dartmouth Hall has taken two years and is still ongoing, and the hot water system likely will not be completed until 2030.\n",
      "Sterman also stressed that energy transitions have many ancillary benefits. For example, energy-efficient buildings are more comfortable and quieter due to increased insulation and better windows. Additionally, these projects create jobs and lead to the better health of those working in the buildings. Rather than being framed as a cost, Sterman stressed that the College should view these changes as an “investment” that protects the itself from volatile fossil fuel prices, enhances the reputation of the school, pays for itself in significantly reduced energy and heating costs and, above all, is aligned with the health and well-being of the planet.\n",
      "On Earth Day in 2017, Dartmouth committed to a wide-ranging set of sustainability goals. This included a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from campus operations by 50% by 2025 and 80% by 2050 and having Dartmouth be supplied with 50% renewable energy by 2025 and 100% by 2050. This was contingent on the now-scrapped idea of building a biomass plant. Dartmouth has since looked into various renewable energy sources but has been radio silent on the actual technologies and strategies it is pursuing. Dartmouth should consider air-source and geothermal heat pumps that can run on clean electricity as they now work in sub-zero climates. There is also plenty of fallow farmland in New Hampshire and Vermont suitable for large-scale solar farms. Additionally, most East Coast states are installing offshore wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean for their power needs. Power from offshore turbines could be fed into the grid at the Seabrook nuclear power plant on the New Hampshire coastline. New Hampshire has favorable topography to build pumped hydroelectric storage facilities to store this solar and wind power.\n",
      "During Earth Day this year, Dartmouth updated campus on its sustainability initiatives. It was my sincere hope going into these announcements that the College would lay out a specific path to sharp emissions reductions. Ultimately, College president Phil Hanlon emailed the student body, announcing — without any supporting data — that Dartmouth’s greenhouse gas emissions had declined 30% from the 2010 baselines, which meant we were closer to the 2025 goal of 50% emissions reduction. 30% efficiency in 12 years is noteworthy, but will it be possible for Dartmouth to reduce emissions by another 20% in three years? I am not so sure. \n",
      "In a significant step forward, Dartmouth’s Board of Trustees agreed in March 2021 on an infrastructure renewal fund. Normally, 5% of the endowment is used to fund the operating budget, and under this new policy this percentage would increase. The IRF would use a percentage of this bolstered operating budget to provide funds for new residential buildings and to make buildings more sustainable and energy-efficient.\n",
      "However, it felt like we took two steps backward at the Earth Day conference when the panel of College administrators  spoke about the annual capital expenditures necessary to maintain Dartmouth’s standing as a world-class educational institution: investing in cutting-edge research, hiring brilliant professors and constructing new buildings, in addition to the energy transition. Concerning the sustainable transition, the panelists said, “We don’t have enough money to do everything we need to across all these dimensions.”\n",
      "Additionally, the panelists mentioned many of the challenges of the energy transition at Dartmouth, including that over 60% of the buildings on campus would have to be totally renovated to meet sustainability standards, and over 90% would need some work done. Given the speed of the construction project at Dartmouth Hall, it is unclear if this can be done in a timely manner. There was also little discussion about specific plans to meet stated goals. Dartmouth currently has a goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. While there was talk of increasing efficiency, there was no mention of any concrete plans or a timeline for the transition to renewable energy — the most crucial aspect for reaching that reduction objective. Five years after Dartmouth set its sustainability goals, it feels like no work has been done. There are plans for a strategic review of Dartmouth’s sustainability goals with updated recommendations in the fall of 2022. I truly hope these are more specific than the Earth Day conference and reflect the situation’s urgency.\n",
      "Dartmouth is largely defined by its external environment. Being surrounded by forests, rivers, lakes and mountains fosters much of the experience of living and studying here. Rather than being a laggard, Dartmouth must fully embrace its motto, Vox clamantis in deserto — “a lone voice crying out in the wilderness.” The biblical verse refers to the call to speak the truth even if you are not being heard. We must be the lone voice crying out in the wilderness for change, to protect the nature that defines our very being. \n",

      "Prestigious universities, such as Dartmouth and its peer institutions, have grown too comfortable with hoarding their billions in endowments as a status symbol, preventing students from benefiting from even the fraction it would take to improve campus facilities and programs. Just last year, the College boasted a 46.5% year-over-year return on its endowment, and instituted a few limited financial changes, including increasing student workers’ hourly minimum wage by $3.75 and eliminating an expected parent contribution in financial aid calculations. While these changes are commendable, institutions like Dartmouth continue to withhold funds from being used more directly for improving the academic and personal lives of their students. It’s past time for the federal government to step in with a stick and tax college endowments. \n",
      "As concentrations of immense wealth, university endowments have the potential to better support students. As the Tax Policy Center points out, public and private university endowments in America account for $500 billion, and just 23 universities hold 50% of this. Dartmouth itself ranks number 19 in American university endowments. On top of this, colleges invest their endowments in the stock market, allowing their assets to accrue interest tax-free. \n",
      "Currently, college endowments are minimally taxed. As 501(c)(3) nonprofits, most private universities are naturally exempt from paying taxes. Some legislative efforts have attempted to address this oversight, such as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that subjected a small number of wealthy universities within a certain endowment threshold to a 1.4% tax. However, House Democrats are now advocating against the Trump-era policy, aiming to lift the tax on around 40 of the nation’s wealthiest colleges.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Advocates against taxing endowments — including universities themselves — argue that universities are nonprofits that advance a socially beneficial cause, and this fact in itself should leave them exempt from taxation. This point is well noted, but colleges fail in this mission of educating and providing resources for students when they hoard their endowments. In order to best support students, colleges must be incentivized to spend on them. And taxation need not be the only solution — others attentive to the issue of university wealth hoarding have advocated for legislation requiring institutions to spend a certain percentage of their endowments annually. This solution would make the treatment of universities more akin to that of private foundations, as opposed to nonprofits. It also incentivizes a direct transfer of endowment wealth to student-focused programs and initiatives.\n",
      "Universities are hesitant to spend their endowment funds for several reasons. Centrally, a college’s endowment is less of a “piggy bank” or pool of readily usable funds and more of a fund governed by extensive restrictions and earmarks for specific programs. Institutions also value the long-term growth of their endowments, putting significant financial efforts into how they invest it and withdrawing from these endowments limits their return on these investments. Typically, a college only spends between 4 and 5% percent of its endowment each year. Finally, an unspoken reason for hesitancy to spend endowments is the correlation between university endowments and rankings — in the race among top universities to boost rankings, they likely feel pressure to boast greater endowment figures. All of these perverse incentives can be mitigated with a federal policy on taxing endowments, pushing colleges to spend them on students.\n",
      "Pushing colleges to spend their endowments may also be a creative way to address economic inequities. As several economic studies have found, blanket student loan forgiveness, like the plan proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is actually a regressive policy, disproportionately benefiting the college-educated upper-middle class. A novel set of education policies — backed by a bipartisan cohort in Congress — includes taxing endowments and actually increases support for meriting students from less privileged backgrounds. \n",
      "Giving universities the nudge on their endowments would also mitigate the issue that University of California Irvine professor Victor Fleischer calls “the symbiotic relationship between university endowments and the world of hedge funds and private equity funds.” Ivy League institutions like Yale, Harvard and Princeton dole out hundreds of millions of dollars to private equity fund managers who invest endowment money. For these institutions, their spending on fund managers actually surpasses their spending on programs for students, including “tuition assistance, fellowships and prizes.” Hedge fund and private equity fund managers, in turn, give large donations to these wealthy universities. While taxing endowments or requiring universities to spend a certain share of them would not entirely eliminate university ties to other rich and powerful institutions, it would at least reduce the issue and put students at the forefront. \n",
      "As it stands, students miss out on countless academic and personal opportunities as a result of these policies, which undermines the supposed aims of these institutions. It is high time for these universities to be forced to place their greed aside and recommit themselves to their students. In short, it’s time to tax university endowments. \n",

      "What comes to mind when you hear the words “Student Assembly”? Please take a moment to think about it.\n",
      "Done? Alright. Here’s what I think: \n",
      "The organization’s structure vastly limits its potential. We have the opportunity to fight for better mental health care, improved infrastructure throughout the College, housing and better dining options, but we do not have the tools to do so effectively. We should be helping facilitate community at a time where we are rebuilding our lives from the pandemic, but we do not have connections to any other governing board at the College. We have elected student representatives who do not show up to any meetings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s why I’m running for Student Body President, along with my running mate: Jessica Chiriboga ’24. We want to reimagine what’s possible for Dartmouth. We need to stand up for students when it matters. That means reforming the Student Assembly. \n",
      "I’ve been a member of Student Assembly since the spring of my freshman year, and I do not take my position for granted — I actually lost my first senate election. Over the past two years, I’ve spent countless hours listening to student concerns. Through social media and in-person conversations, I’ve engaged with thousands of students, hearing from different parts of campus and working to serve you all the best I can.\n",
      "We’re unopposed, but we still believe we need to earn your vote and this position. Every vote on Monday matters and directly influences what we can do next year. We need to show the administration that the campus is united behind what we’re fighting to do. We plan to restructure Student Assembly into a new organization entirely, simply renamed: Dartmouth Student Government (DSG). \n",
      "This name change is important because we need to clarify our role on campus to students. Right now, Student Assembly’s purpose is to “serve as the primary liaison between the undergraduate student body and the administration, faculty, staff, and persons or groups outside of the University.” I don’t believe this should be the mission of the student government. We should be representing students directly. Being a liaison organization implies we are just an extension of the administration. Beyond just semantics, this means creating a cabinet where there is none, establishing a communications team and making sure to engage all parts of campus in decision making. We want to have a system where any student who wants to help us can, and we imagine this through a new at-large representative system. \n",
      "This change can mark a new era for Dartmouth student representation. A new era of addressing real issues with all the power we have. It means working to establish universal teletherapy, or to expand after-hours dining options like Collis Late Night or to reinstate safe rides and create a student representative on the board of trustees. Beyond just goals, however, we offer you all concrete plans in our platform. \n",
      "In my eyes, student government has two tools for change: advocacy and initiatives. Effective advocacy for issues that are outside of our organization comes from an effective structure and a willingness to combat administration directly. As I hope people learned from my Selectboard race, I’m no stranger to confronting bad-faith actors when I believe something will truly help people. We want to establish a cabinet, an accountability structure for elected senators and a constituent services wing. We also want to facilitate connection to other governing bodies through a representative Dartmouth Undergraduate Leadership Council (DULC). Imagine all of the groups coming together to fight for real campus issues, like a student on the board of trustees.\n",
      "We have a budget that itself can be used to solve campus issues. We can alleviate food insecurity through the campus food pantry, aid transportation to campus through the Coach voucher program, improve mental health through wellness center creation and get real student opinions about campus resources through advertised and incentivized surveys.\n",
      "We ask for you to vote to support our vision for what next year can be. Voting opens at 5 p.m. on Monday and closes at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, through Engage. \n",
      "Honestly? I’m tired of feeling powerless at this College. \n",

      "On Wednesday night, James O’Keefe, author and founder of non-profit organization Project Veritas, visited campus for a talk hosted by the Dartmouth College Republicans. Over the course of an hour, O’Keefe discussed his organization's work in front of approximately 100 guests. Topics included several cases Project Veritas covered of alleged corruption among political, media and private figures, which O’Keefe said amounted to “threats to democracy.”\n",
      "According to its website, Project Veritas “investigates and exposes corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud and other misconduct in both public and private institutions to achieve a more ethical and transparent society.” Using undercover journalists, the organization has recorded both politicians and public figures and produced videos of the encounters — often misrepresenting subjects through edited footage, according to The New York Times. The organization is currently under federal investigation for how it came into possession of Ashley Biden’s belongings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Attendees were offered logoed apparel such as stuffed animals labeled “Retracto Alpacas,” hats reading “The New York Lies” — an apparent spoof on The New York Times — and other apparel as they filed into Filene Auditorium.\n",
      "Chloe Ezzo ’22, president of the Dartmouth College Republicans, opened the event by introducing O’Keefe and Project Veritas, which she said had “exposed” the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, CNN, National Public Radio, the New Jersey Teachers Association, The New York Times, Planned Parenthood and the U.S. government.\n",
      "“Faith in the mainstream media is at an all-time low and for good reason,” Ezzo said at the event. \n",
      "O’Keefe began his presentation with a speech of an opinion column published in The Dartmouth on Tuesday. The piece was written by senior staff columnist and former editor-in-chief Kyle Mullins ’22. In his column, Mullins expressed discontent with the College Republicans’ decision to bring a “bad faith” speaker to campus. O’Keefe called Mullins’ claims “serious accusations” and proceeded to tell the audience he would “write a $10,000 check” to anyone who could name an instance in which O’Keefe had “deceptively edited” journalism in the past decade. \n",
      "“Every argument he’s written [in the column] appears to be false,” O’Keefe said. \n",
      "In a written statement to The Dartmouth, Mullins said that he was aware O’Keefe had discussed his piece during the event and said that the event did “nothing to create open or productive discourse on campus.”\n",
      "“O’Keefe’s accusations of intentional bias — on my part or on the part of The Dartmouth — hold no water, and his efforts to undermine trust in the free press nationwide are damaging to democracy and free speech,” Mullins wrote. \n",
      "Mullins added that his own views do not represent those of The Dartmouth — “either during my tenure as editor-in-chief or now.”  \n",
      "“The divide between opinion writing and news reporting is clear,” Mullins wrote.\n",
      "O’Keefe then discussed a range of Project Veritas’ coverage, which he called “things that powerful people don’t want to expose” — including an ABC news tape concerning coverage of Jeffrey Epstein, a video of a Texas woman facing charges of election fraud and a video of a CNN staffer discussing how the network worked to favorably portray then-presidential candidate Joe Biden during the 2020 election.\n",
      "“There's nothing wrong with CNN being a network that's dedicated to ‘getting Trump out,’ but why don’t you just call it ‘CNN — dedicated to getting Trump out’ as opposed to ‘CNN — the most trusted name in news?’” O’Keefe asked. “I don't hide anything I believe in.”\n",
      "O’Keefe noted his concerns over a “lack of real investigative journalism.” \n",
      "“We need people to be brave and do something, which is our motto [at Project Veritas],” O’Keefe said. \n",
      "O’Keefe also discussed a number of pending Project Veritas lawsuits, including the group’s recent efforts to sue The New York Times. Project Veritas has accused the newspaper of violating attorney-client privilege rights. However, a decision by a New York state appeals court in February ruled in favor of The New York Times, temporarily allowing The Times to publish Project Veritas documents.\n",
      "O’Keefe also discussed Project Veritas’ work to obtain Ashley Biden’s diary — an effort that has been the subject of an investigation by federal prosecutors. Project Veritas has denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that Biden’s belongings were abandoned. \n",
      "In an interview with The Dartmouth after the event, O’Keefe said the talk was “well-attended,” adding that he was “happy to be here and talk about truth and journalism in the modern era.”\n",
      "Seven Sassano ’22 said she was surprised by the lack of student attendance at the event. \n",
      "“It was mostly [Upper Valley] community members,” Sassano said. “We didn’t really have any student involvement, which was a little disappointing.” \n",

      "I was in that fuzzy space between sleeping and waking when I remembered that I couldn’t remember. The trash can beside the bed, the backwards t-shirt, the taste of frat in my mouth. Nice. Within minutes I was out the door, sneakers slamming hard against the cracked sidewalks. There was a part of me that desired some sort of physical undoing, like the act of sweating would somehow rid me of my poor decisions from the night before. I ran four miles that morning and jumped into the Connecticut with all my clothes on, probably still half-drunk. Soggy and confused, I returned to my room with the lyric line of “Why the fuck did I just do that?” reverberating around the inside of my skull. I didn’t know the answer to my own question, but I suspected that it had something to do with what I couldn’t process, what I didn’t want to sit in. Waking up to the taste of stale tequila on your tongue and foreign bruises all down your body from drunken falls makes for a depressing morning.\n",
      "I’ve blacked out twice in my life. The first time was when I was 15 and tried hard alcohol for the first time, completely unaware of my limits or how the sharp, clear liquid in a pretty bottle could magically erase an entire night’s memory. The second time was on a random night during fall 2021, and there was literally no rhyme or reason to why it happened. I had gone way too hard for no good reason, but I soon became aware of the universality of this experience for college students, however perplexing and unappealing it seems to the non-drinker and drinker alike.\n",
      "I think about alcohol a lot, perhaps because I have some personal stake in the matter. My family has a history of alcoholism, and just this past summer, someone within my immediate family ended up in the ICU because of it. I wonder why we’re so much worse than our parents were, why beer isn’t enough, why we don’t stop after one, two, even three blackouts, why it’s become so commonplace to drink yourself to regurgitation or unconsciousness. The fact that men’s rush culture encourages knocking back as much alcohol as you can without puking, the fact that I know only the intoxicated versions of too many people here, the fact that going out isn’t fun unless you’re drunk doesn’t sit well with me — like too many Keystones on an empty stomach. And there’s hardly ever a compelling justification for any of it. We get smashed just to say we got smashed, then limp back to our flimsy college-grade mattresses to sleep off the poison in our bodies before we rise for another round of overachieving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "I’ve run through the possible reasons for our generation’s appalling relationship with alcohol. Do we drink to forget or remember? To feel something or nothing at all? Is it panic? Are we afraid that we’ve lost too much time to the pandemic to not squeeze all the wild nights of our youth into four years of binge drinking? Is what we really crave when we drink the brave, bold versions of ourselves that exist only in the context of intoxication? I mean, what else is there to do in the middle of nowhere?\n",
      "I’d love to believe in our parents’ romantic notion that we do it because it makes us look cool. It certainly makes for a nice image: The attractive Dartmouth partiers, clad in seersucker and silk, lapping magic liquid from crystal glasses and getting buzzed enough to actually understand Kant. But this absurd romanticisation doesn’t usually withstand the reality of Dartmouth pregames, with their vodka-crans in Nalgenes, sneakers coated in the elusive film of frat basement and the ever-present conviction that the night will end in either boredom or vomit. \n",
      "There is some truth to all of these possibilities, I suppose. For me, drinking masks the disappointment of Dartmouth’s social scene, makes me far more ballsy with my frat-boy banter (and I’ll admit that all the boys I’ve met here seem far more interesting when I’m under the influence) and suspends me in a world that doesn’t seem to require anything of me. The lack of responsibility, is that it? Perhaps we’re so anxious about entering the real world that we’ve resorted to pumping ourselves full of toxins to temporarily alleviate the pressure of what’s to come.\n",
      "Whatever the reason — and we all have our reasons — it’s certainly worth thinking about, lest we forget the real-life dangers that accompany the throat burn of a shot or the intolerable, fruity carbonation of a White Claw Surge. Though my past behavior bars me from taking any moral high ground, I believe it’s worth giving more critical attention to why we drink and the implications of having a college culture obsessed with the altered state of intoxication.\n",

      "                                                by Parker O'Hara\n",
      "                                                                                                 | 4/27/22 2:10am\n",

      "Though the stress and excitement of Ivy Day, when many Ivy League colleges release admissions decisions, has passed, a difficult decision awaits the 1,207 students admitted to Dartmouth for the Class of 2026. As opposed to students admitted via early decision in December, students admitted on Ivy Day are not bound to accept their decision. Rather, they have the gift — or burden — of being able to choose where they will enroll.\n",
      "From the perspective of a high school senior, this decision can feel nearly impossible. College is not just a place where students will spend the next four years — it’s also a pivotal time with the potential to change the rest of their lives. Especially during the college admissions process, the prevailing narrative is that choosing correctly means the best four years of your life followed by success and fulfillment, and it seems like picking the wrong school could set your life trajectory permanently off track. In reality, college is not the only pivotal moment in people’s lives, but it is a big one, and the college decision isn’t one most students make lightly.\n",
      "Over the past few weeks, hoards of prospective ’26s have swarmed to campus in an attempt to find last-minute insight to bring clarity to their college decision. Directed by student tour guides  who are employed by the Admissions Office, these groups of anxious-looking high school seniors arrive at Dartmouth hoping to gain a sense of what their life might look like at the College on the hill. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For ’25s admitted during the regular decision cycle last year, the presence of prospective ’26s is a reminder of that difficult process, which has inspired some of them to reflect on why they chose Dartmouth and how it’s living up to their expectations nearly one year later. Ultimately, each of the ’25s I spoke with saw something in Dartmouth that distinguished it enough to sway their decision.\n",
      "For both Logan Dailey ’25 and Jamison Poate ’25, visiting campus was instrumental in making their decision. Just as prospective ’26s are doing now, visiting gave them an opportunity to experience student life and campus culture from a more authentic perspective.\n",
      "“When I came and visited, everyone was super nice,” Dailey said. “Some girl gave me an unofficial tour even though we had just met, which was dope. ​​She was super welcoming and showed a lot of passion for the school which was one thing that influenced me to choose [Dartmouth].”\n",
      "Poate recounted a similar experience.\n",
      "“When I visited, everyone was out on the Green and they were all really nice,” Poate said. “It just looked like a really fun place to be.”\n",
      "For Gracie Kim ’25 and Kevin Cao ’25, Dartmouth’s unique identity as the only liberal arts college in the Ivy League was an appealing characteristic. \n",
      "“I felt that in a lot of other universities a lot of opportunities would only go to graduate students,” Cao said. “Here, we specifically had the most resources and there was best teaching around solely for undergraduates.”\n",
      "Particularly for Kim, who “wasn’t sure what [she] wanted to do at first,” the prospect of academic exploration was enticing.\n",
      "“I am able to explore and be educated in a whole host of different areas and fields,” Kim said. “For me specifically, I’m currently very interested in music, economics and computer science, and I feel that Dartmouth allows me to pursue all three.” \n",
      "One of Dartmouth’s most unique qualities — the D-Plan — was the final deciding factor for Sam Roth Gordon ’25. \n",
      "The distinct academic schedule, Roth Gordon explained, “allowed for taking more classes in a wide range of topics without having to worry as much about major requirements, as well as the ability to take multiple off or study abroad terms.”\n",
      "Now, after surviving the newness of freshmen fall, the frigidness of winter term and the first few exciting weeks of their final term as freshmen, ’25s reflected on how Dartmouth has lived up to their expectations. Have the factors that made them choose Dartmouth — the liberal arts education, the undergraduate focus, the D-Plan and the tight-knit community — played out in the way they had hoped?\n",
      "Given the various ways Dartmouth has differed from their expectations, students reflected on their decision to attend with sometimes mixed feelings. Will Ermath ’25 said his experience has been different than expected, but not necessarily because of the College. Rather, he echoed a familiar sentiment for many Dartmouth students.\n",
      "“I thought I would have more things figured out — like what I am going to major in,” Ermath said. “Now I realize that is unrealistic, and I still need time to figure out what I like to do and what I want to study.” \n",
      "Dartmouth’s relatively remote location in the New Hampshire woods can be frightening for prospective students. Aran Flaherty ’25 admitted she shared this doubt, but was pleasantly surprised by the wide array of activities she has found.\n",
      "“I was expecting to be a little bored in the woods,” Flaherty said. “I knew I’d have fun and have a good time, but I was a little concerned about what do [students] do here? But there’s obviously so, so much to do.”\n",
      "Of course, student satisfaction is variable, and how much someone likes Dartmouth depends on when you ask. Perhaps the loneliness of the first few days or the frequent dips below zero degrees pushed this answer temporarily toward the negative. Maybe the excitement of the Homecoming bonfire or leisurely days spent on the Green confirmed they made the right decision. \n",
      "Denise Lee ’25 and Kim both seemed to have no regrets about their decision, except the mouse problem in the River Cluster dorms and disappointing Foco dining options.\n",
      "Flaherty has only ever felt regret when realizing that Dartmouth’s sports culture left much to be desired compared to other schools, although this was not enough of a negative to make her regret her decision. As a high school senior, she was deciding between Notre Dame and Dartmouth.\n",
      "“The only time I ever have regretted my decision was when I went to our football game. Notre Dame has amazing football game days … everything,” Flaherty said. “I got over that obviously, because we offer so much to other stuff.”\n",
      "For both Poate and Grant Foley ’25, the people have made the place. \n",
      "“I wasn’t expecting to find as good of friends as I did so quickly, but I think everyone here is very outgoing and friendly,” Poate said. “From the first day on campus, I really noticed that. I was originally thinking it was going [to] be a school that didn't foster [good friendships] because of its competitive academic stature, but it does.”\n",
      "When measured against the metric of friendship, Dartmouth didn’t disappoint.\n",
      "“A large part of the Dartmouth pitch was how wonderful the other students and the community are, and I have found that to truly be the best part,” Foley said. “When winter gets difficult or when life here becomes overwhelming, friends continue to be the highlight.”\n",

      "Article: April 28, 2022 | Latest IssueAs the effects of inflation, labor shortages and the prospect of a recession loom over the national economy, Hanover business owners said they have faced unique challenges in finding ways to adapt their business models. Business owners also mentioned that the high living costs of the Upper Valley and seasonal flow of business around the Collegepose further difficulties with employment.According to The New York Times, the consumer price index, which measures general prices of goods and services in an economy, was 8.5% higher in March 2022 than it was a year ago, marking the highest inflation rate in 30 years.The effects of high national inflation are playing out in Hanover, where local business owners said they are grappling with expensive shipping costs and production delays.Bryan Smith, owner of Hanover poster store rpmNH, said plastic top holders for posters have doubled in price since the start of the pandemic, while Lemon Tree Gifts owner Melissa Haas said the cost of shipping for her business has “quadrupled” in the past six months.“I don’t think there’s a single company I’ve worked with who hasn’t been affected [by inflation],” Haas said. “Some companies are still putting heavy surcharges on overseas shipments to account for shipping costs … and they’re getting more and more comfortable [doing so].”Economics professor Elisabeth Curtis said that while the causes of the current wave of inflation are not fully understood, it is likely driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain shortages. In addition, inflationary prices may have been “exacerbated” by the ongoing war in Ukraine which has disrupted food and energy markets. Curtis also pointed towards the possibility of a wage-price spiral — a situation in which consumers spend more now in expectation of future price increases — which creates “self-fulfilling inflationary expectations.”“When I teach my [macroeconomics] class, I’ve had to teach [inflation] in an imaginary situation,” Curtis said. “We haven’t had inflationary pressures for a very long time, so we’ve almost forgotten what inflation looks like and how to live with it.”In response to rising production costs, Haas said she is trying to “meet in the middle” by increasing prices by “a few dollars here and there” for customers, but she said she has stopped purchasing some items because of large cost increases.Hanover Strings manager Duncan Carroll said that the store has managed to avoid significant price increases since they stocked up on inventory at the beginning of the pandemic.“We could tell there was something serious going on with the pandemic and that our suppliers would be completely closed,” Carroll said. “We bought a ton of stuff at that point, and that’s the only reason we made it through the pandemic — because we acted really quickly.”In addition, both Smith and Haas said that ongoing supply chain shortages have affected their ability to purchase items. Haas added that because of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China, some manufacturers have been unable to produce items like manicure sets or nail files, which they have “typically been able to get for years.”She added that there are significant production delays for some items now, noting that she has only recently received items which were originally slated to arrive last Christmas.“I don’t know if I can buy them again in time [for next Christmas], so I’m [buying] things now that I wouldn’t normally,” she said.Beyond the problems created by inflation, Curtis said that “the [United States] is closer to full employment than ever,” but there is still a persistent “mismatch” in the labor market as employers cannot find employees with desired skills. She added that Hanover’s businesses face unique challenges as most full-time job seekers, apart from those associated with the College, do not live in Hanover due to the high cost of living.Smith said that although he has not faced difficulties hiring part-time workers, he has been unable to fill full-time management positions. Similarly, Haas said the term “labor shortage” is the “understatement of the century,” adding that “it’s been a huge problem” as she has been unable to hire a manager for several months now.Curtis said that the “gazillion-dollar question” now is whether the U.S. will soon head into a recession. She noted that economists disagree on whether interest rate increases can rein in inflation, adding that the Federal Reserve must strike a balance by understanding the causes of inflation and acting appropriately.The last time inflation rates were this high — the late 1970s and early 1980s — the Federal Reserve sharply increased interest rates and tightened monetary policy to reduce inflation, contributing to a recession and increased unemployment rates, according to Curtis.Smith expressed worries about the potential effects of a recession. He added that rent is “very high” and that foot traffic to his store is inherently cyclical, as prospective students and tourists mostly visit from May to October.Haas said that she has not thought about the possibility of a recession.“It’s just too much to think about,” she said. “I feel like I have to live in the moment, think one day at a time right now.”Carroll expressed optimism about the future.“There’s no rushing your way out of the pandemic,” he said. “You just have to stay busy and stay focused … We’re going to come out of this so much stronger and better than we were before.”\n"
