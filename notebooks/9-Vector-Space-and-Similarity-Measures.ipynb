When comparing multiple vectors for visualization in two or three dimensions we might choose principal components analysis or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding to reduce the dimensionality of our data. These methods all produce alternate representations of vector space that introduce distortions and give greater significance to some aspects of data. They do not alter nor do they rewrite the vector space model but they do create a new representation of this space.

This is really useful because it means that we can directly compare short and long bodies of text.\n",
