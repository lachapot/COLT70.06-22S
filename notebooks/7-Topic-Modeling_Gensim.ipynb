    "## Introduction to Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a more obscure process than, for example, TF-IDF.  TF-IDF is rules-based and the algorithm is transparent, whereas topic modeling is an unsupervised approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling sorts words together based on co-occurrence probabilities. It sorts words from a collection of document into likely clusters of co-occurring words, i.e. how often words likely appear close to one another. These are the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You determine that there is a certain number of topics that constitutes each document. The model then estimates the probability of each word in the documents of belonging to a topic. It iterates over and over adjusting each time its probability scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with other text analysis methods, there are different algorithms for implementing the topic modeling process. One of the most popular implementations of topic modeling is LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA’s approach to topic modeling is that it considers each document as a collection of topics in a certain proportion. And each topic as a collection of keywords, again, in a certain proportion. Once you provide the algorithm with the number of topics, all it does it to rearrange the topics distribution within the documents and keywords distribution within the topics to obtain a good composition of topic-keywords distribution. LDA is non-deterministic. This means that a different result can be obtained for each run. Fortunately, the result usually converges towards a stable state. Run it several times and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers LDA implementation in Gensim. [MALLET](https://mimno.github.io/Mallet/) is another popular LDA implementation - some argue it is more efficient and give better topic segregation. It’s also quite intuitive to use, but it’s difficult to set up through JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic Modeling Outputs** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we’ll look at two main topic modeling outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Topics (probability distributions of words over documents)_: each topic is a list of likely frequently co-occurring terms and each word more or less characteristic of the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "_Distributions of topics over documents_: list the more characteristic topics for each topic and how strongly the document is associated with the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A topic model provides a different perspective on a collection. It creates a set of probability distributions over the vocabulary of the collection, which, when combined together in different proportions, best match the content of the collection. We can sort the words in each of these distributions in descending order by probability, take some arbitrary number of most-probable words, and get a sense of what (if anything) the topic is “about.” Each of the text segments also has its own distribution over the topics, and we can sort these segments by their probability within a given topic to get a sense of how that topic is used.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting topic models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is useful to get a sense of the patterns across a corpus and to identify patterns you might want to look into further. \n",
    "\n",
    "> “Topic models (e.g., LDA, Blei et al., 2003) are usually unsupervised and therefore less biased toward human-defined categories. They are especially suited for insight-driven analysis, because they are constrained in ways that make their output interpretable. Although there is no guarantee that a “topic” will correspond to a recognizable theme or event or discourse, they often do so in ways that other methods do not. Their easy applicability without supervision and ready interpretability make topic models good for exploration. Topic models are less successful for many performance-driven applications. Raw word features are almost always better than topics for search and document classification. LSTMs and other neural network models are better as language models. Continuous word embeddings have more expressive power to represent fine-grained semantic similarities between words.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling was introduced to the wider public as an information retrieval and categorization tool: as a way of categorizing documents by identifying its overarching themes. This created a sense that topic modeling outputs coherent categories that represent themes in documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it’s important to keep in mind that topic models identify consistent patterns across a corpus. They will identify features of language that likely frequently co-occur. These patterns can seem like “topics”, like coherent themes, because (according to the distributional hypothesis) words that share the same context, words that frequently occur close together, \n",
    "generate meaning, are proxies of meaning. When a document contains words such as “telescope”, “sky”, “planet”, “star” this can indicate that the document probably relates to astronomy. However, a document that contains words such as “star”, “famous”, “fans”, “film” suggests a different kind of meaning, or topic being discussed. Topic modeling picks up on these different groupings. \n",
    "\n",
    "> “Indeed calling these models “topic models” is retrospective — the topics that emerge from the inference algorithm are interpretable for almost any collection that is analyzed. The fact that these look like topics has to do with the statistical structure of observed language and how it interacts with the specific probabilistic assumptions of LDA.” (Blei, “Probabilistic Topic Models” footnote p. 79)\n",
    "\n",
    "But consistent patterns of words don’t necessarily simply equate with themes or topics, what a text is “about”. If there is one document or set of documents in your corpus that consistently repeats particular words or phrases this will be picked up as a pattern. Sometimes it’s significant, sometimes it’s not. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are comparing documents that are of different types (e.g. newspapers v transcripts or plays v novels etc.) models will likely pick up on different language conventions that typify each genre which may or may not be relevant for your analysis. Similarly, if some document contain distinctive language or dialect features these can be grouped together as a topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "> “Longer or extended poems that outsize the majority of other documents in the subset pull one or more topics toward language specific to that particular poem. (…) one poem with high levels of repetition can pull a topic away from the rest of the corpus, along with other poems with high frequency repetitions of particular phrases” (Rhody, “Topic Modeling and Figurative Language”)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models can pick up on recurring preprocessing errors, e.g. if there are OCR misspelling or words repeatedly split at the end of lines \n",
    "\n",
    "> “After fitting the model, it may be necessary to circle back to an earlier phase. Topic models find consistent patterns. When authors repeatedly use a particular theme or discourse, that repetition creates a consistent pattern. But other factors can also create similar patterns, which look as good to the algorithm. We might notice a topic that has highest probability on French stopwords, indicating that we need to do a better job of filtering by language. We might notice a topic of word fragments, such as “ing,” “tion,” “inter,” indicating that we are not handling end-of- line hyphenation correctly. We may need to add to our stoplist or change how we curate multi-word terms.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning Topic Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges with topic modeling is generating outputs that are meaningful and relevant. It will take some experimentation. Two of the most important aspects for generating meaningful topics is preprocessing and the number of topics. There is no general rule for how many topic is a good number of topics. This will take some tuning and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “One of the most common questions about topic models is how many topics to use, usually with the implicit assumption that there is a “right” number that is inherent in the collection. We prefer to think of this parameter as more like the scale of a map or the magnification of a microscope. The “right” number is determined by the needs of the user, not by the collection. If the analyst is looking for a broad overview, a relatively small number of topics may be best. If the analyst is looking for fine-grained phenomena, a larger number is better.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 9-10)"
