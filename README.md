## Course Description: 
There are around 7,000 languages spoken across the world, yet only 500 of these are used in the digital world and even fewer are supported by fundamental digital infrastructures. Computational methods for analyzing language are being implemented across a growing range of domains, but do those methods work equally well for all languages? How transferrable are computational text analysis methods across languages and contexts? In this course, we will apply insights from cultural studies and comparative literature to investigate how history, language and culture shape our digital practices. In addition, we will consider the new possibilities and specific challenges of working with digitized texts and computational methods to analyze modern languages and literatures.
