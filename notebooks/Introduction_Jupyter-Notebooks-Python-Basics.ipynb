    "Jupyter notebooks therefore allow you to combine code, text, images etc. all in one place. You can edit and run code in a notebook which makes it an ideal place to play around and test out code. The possibilities of combining code and text afforded b Notebooks are not only useful as a pedagogical and learning environment, but can also offer a way to make our analytical process explicit and to reflect on our analytical process:\n",

    "> \"Notebooks are theory — not merely code as theory but theory as thoughtful engagement with the theoretical work and implications of the code itself. Disciplinary norms— including contextual framing, theory, and self or auto-critique— need to accompany, supplement, and inform any computational criticism. Revealing as much of the code, data, and methods as possible is essential to enable the ongoing disciplinary conversation. Compiling these together in a single object, one that can be exported, shared, examined, and executed by others, produces a dynamic type of theorization that is modular yet tightly bound up with its object.\" (Dobson, James.
