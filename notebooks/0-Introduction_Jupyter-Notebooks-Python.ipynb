Disciplinary norms— including contextual framing, theory, and self or auto-critique— need to accompany, supplement, and inform any computational criticism. Revealing as much of the code, data, and methods as possible is essential to enable the ongoing disciplinary conversation.

This is the path to the contexts of the texts directory. If you click back to the home directory, you move back one layer in the file structure to your home directory.

    "The aim of this course is that you become comfortable reading code and adapting it to your needs. It somewhat follows the ideas of “literate programming” or “literate computing” put forward by Donald Knuth in the 1970s that inspired to creation of Jupyter Notebooks. The idea of literate programming is that code can be written and presented in ways that highlight it as a human written cultural artifact — instead of prioritizing code as it is read by computers, literature programming wants to find ways of writing and reading code that make code more readable and understanding to human beings and that highlight the writer’s own thought processes. These ideas motivated the creation of Jupyter Notebooks to provide environments that can combine human prose with executable code. (cf. Knuth, Donald. _Literate Programming_. (1992) and this Programming Historian´s [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks).)"

It could be for example that you forgot to close a quotation mark, or that you forgot a colon after a ´for´ loop. If you are copy and pasting code, check that the quotation marks are the right kind of quotation mark that Python recognizes.
