      "As of Tuesday, there are 525 reported active cases of COVID-19 on campus, an increase from the 329 active cases reported on April 13, according to the College COVID-19 dashboard. In an email sent to campus on April 19, provost David Kotz wrote that current case counts represent self-reported positive cases, as well as symptomatic and voluntary on-campus tests. \n",

This is the highest number of cases since Jan. 29, when there were 544 active cases on campus. In addition, there are  123 cases among graduate and professional students, a slight increase from last week’s case total of 103, and 85 cases among faculty and staff members, a figure that has more than doubled for the second week in a row. \n",

      "As of Tuesday, there are 329 reported active cases of COVID-19 on campus, a spike from the 199 cases reported on April 11, according to the College COVID-19 dashboard. Reported cases continue to increase even after the College’s decision to make asymptomatic testing optional, which took effect on April 10. \n",
      "The figure is made up of 196 undergraduate students, 103 graduate or professional students and 40 faculty members and staff. The number of active cases of COVID-19 in graduate and professional students more than doubled in two days, increasing from 42 cases on April 11.\n",
      "April 11 | 10:30 p.m.\n",
      "COVID-19 cases on campus continue to increase — the College COVID-19 Dashboard reported 199 active COVID-19 cases, up from the 155 reported on April 6. The figure includes 133 undergraduates, 42 graduate and professional students and 24 faculty members and staff. The biggest jump in active cases comes from undergraduates, which increased by 55 cases from last Wednesday. \n",
      "As of April 10, asymptomatic testing became optional at the College, though students will still have access to in-person and drop-off testing options, according to a March 30 email from executive vice president Rick Mills and provost David Kotz. \n",
      "According to the dashboard, 97.9% of the community is fully vaccinated, the same as last week. Meanwhile, 96.1% are up to date on their vaccinations — meaning they have received a booster shot — in a 0.2% increase from last week. \n",
      "\n",
      "April 6 | 10:00 p.m.\n",
      "Active COVID-19 cases increased to 155 today from the 114 reported by the College COVID-19 dashboard last Wednesday. This number includes 78 among undergraduates, 66 among graduate and professional students and 11 among faculty and staff. The sharpest rise was among undergraduates, up 49 from 29 cases on March 30. According to the dashboard, 97.9% of the community is fully vaccinated, with 95.9% up to date with their vaccinations — meaning they have received a booster shot. \n",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the positivity rate for tests in Grafton County is 1.79% as of April 3, a 0.55% drop over the last seven days. The dashboard noted that 74.9% of the total population is fully vaccinated, with 95% having received at least one dose of the vaccine. \n",
      "\n",
      "March 30 | 10:00 p.m.\n",
      "On March 30 — the third day of classes in a term with fewer Covid restrictions — the Dartmouth COVID-19 dashboard displayed 114 active cases, including 29 among undergraduates, 77 among graduate and professional students and eight among faculty and staff. 98% of the Dartmouth community is fully vaccinated, with 94.6% up to date on their vaccinations, according to the dashboard. Community members classified as “up to date” on vaccinations have received a booster shot.\n",
      "According to a March 17 email from the College, the dashboard will no longer display positivity rates or the number of people in isolation. This term, starting on April 10, Dartmouth will move away from weekly surveillance testing to an “as-needed testing model,” according to the email. Additionally, the email noted that Dartmouth leadership will continue to consult guidance at the federal, state and local levels, alongside scientific guidance, to determine “effective metrics” for the ongoing pandemic response. \n",
      "College spokesperson Diana Lawrence wrote in an emailed statement that the College anticipated an increase in cases as students returned from spring break. \n",
      "“We will be following these numbers closely over the coming weeks to identify whether the case counts continue to rise after start-of-term testing, or if they stabilize or decline,” she wrote. \n",
      "Lawrence wrote that students were not required to complete pre-arrival tests this term, so the positive cases reflected on the dashboard were detected in both PCR and antigen tests conducted on campus and tests taken in the Upper Valley. She  added that the “relatively high case counts” for graduate students relative to undergraduates is due to the earlier semester start date for the Tuck School of Business, leading to an additional week of testing among graduate students reported on the dashboard. \n",
      "The Dartmouth will post short COVID-19 updates here throughout the 2022 spring term. Major developments, such as policy announcements, may be posted separately as their own article. Check back here for updates on current case counts and other campus developments.\n",

      "A 1:1 episode adaptation again. Looks like our lady Yor already moved into the Forger’s place and Anya is very mannered indeed, heck she can do some cleaning too. Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

      "Heck in order to solve that, they need to broaden their cultural knowledge by going to some performance art, museum, fine dining, etc, and I’m so excited to see Yuri’s appearance when Yor mentioned her care for him lol + Anya drawing in some wall was also another original anime scene, holy sheet so many unfamiliar scenes I’m pointing but it’s interesting they’re doing a 1:1 adaptation for the 3 first episodes and these original scenes could expand more in the family’s dynamism mhm mhm. \n",

Although Loid's patience is wearing, and Yor's sadistic tendencies are showing a little bit, when they and Anya really try, they look like one happy family. From walking in the park, to visiting a couple of functions, and that weird time where Loid downed a pickpocketing man, they sure are dynamic for a nuclear family.\n",

      "But seeing them connect for the first time is actually nice to see, it's all hazy from here on out but I'm sure they'll figure it out (with an upcoming F9 dead meme) as a family.

      "Another great episode. This time around, we saw all three of them being a cute little family, and Loid also trying to make them learn things, so they can enter the Eden. While they're trying their best, they mess many things up which is expected from a newly made family but they're making progress. Anya with her assists is always great. LOL. Love seeing them act like a family. That family photo was really cute. :3\n",

      "A 1:1 episode adaptation again. Looks like our lady Yor already moved into the Forger’s place and Anya is very mannered indeed, heck she can do some cleaning too. Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

      "Interviewing to get into a new school especially ones that has a high acceptance rate is very difficult to get into because you have to provide a very proper point and try to elaborate on it so yeah this stuff is something though it’s not accurately portrayed but anyone would’ve been there and done that but in the case of the Forger’s family seems going to be tough because Anya and Yor are both starting on their own self instead of being a slight objective to the question Loid is asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heck in order to solve that, they need to broaden their cultural knowledge by going to some performance art, museum, fine dining, etc, and I’m so excited to see Yuri’s appearance when Yor mentioned her care for him lol + Anya drawing in some wall was also another original anime scene, holy sheet so many unfamiliar scenes I’m pointing but it’s interesting they’re doing a 1:1 adaptation for the 3 first episodes and these original scenes could expand more in the family’s dynamism mhm mhm. \n",

While they're trying their best, they mess many things up which is expected from a newly made family but they're making progress. Anya with her assists is always great. LOL.

      "A 1:1 episode adaptation again. Looks like our lady Yor already moved into the Forger’s place and Anya is very mannered indeed, heck she can do some cleaning too. Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

      "Interviewing to get into a new school especially ones that has a high acceptance rate is very difficult to get into because you have to provide a very proper point and try to elaborate on it so yeah this stuff is something though it’s not accurately portrayed but anyone would’ve been there and done that but in the case of the Forger’s family seems going to be tough because Anya and Yor are both starting on their own self instead of being a slight objective to the question Loid is asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heck in order to solve that, they need to broaden their cultural knowledge by going to some performance art, museum, fine dining, etc, and I’m so excited to see Yuri’s appearance when Yor mentioned her care for him lol + Anya drawing in some wall was also another original anime scene, holy sheet so many unfamiliar scenes I’m pointing but it’s interesting they’re doing a 1:1 adaptation for the 3 first episodes and these original scenes could expand more in the family’s dynamism mhm mhm. \n",

Although Loid's patience is wearing, and Yor's sadistic tendencies are showing a little bit, when they and Anya really try, they look like one happy family. From walking in the park, to visiting a couple of functions, and that weird time where Loid downed a pickpocketing man, they sure are dynamic for a nuclear family.\n",

      "But seeing them connect for the first time is actually nice to see, it's all hazy from here on out but I'm sure they'll figure it out (with an upcoming F9 dead meme) as a family.

Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

Although Loid's patience is wearing, and Yor's sadistic tendencies are showing a little bit, when they and Anya really try, they look like one happy family. From walking in the park, to visiting a couple of functions, and that weird time where Loid downed a pickpocketing man, they sure are dynamic for a nuclear family.\n",

      "But seeing them connect for the first time is actually nice to see, it's all hazy from here on out but I'm sure they'll figure it out (with an upcoming F9 dead meme) as a family.

We're only getting to the fun part, but right now I'm already having joy watching.  BBCode\n",

      "A 1:1 episode adaptation again. Looks like our lady Yor already moved into the Forger’s place and Anya is very mannered indeed, heck she can do some cleaning too. Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

      "Interviewing to get into a new school especially ones that has a high acceptance rate is very difficult to get into because you have to provide a very proper point and try to elaborate on it so yeah this stuff is something though it’s not accurately portrayed but anyone would’ve been there and done that but in the case of the Forger’s family seems going to be tough because Anya and Yor are both starting on their own self instead of being a slight objective to the question Loid is asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heck in order to solve that, they need to broaden their cultural knowledge by going to some performance art, museum, fine dining, etc, and I’m so excited to see Yuri’s appearance when Yor mentioned her care for him lol + Anya drawing in some wall was also another original anime scene, holy sheet so many unfamiliar scenes I’m pointing but it’s interesting they’re doing a 1:1 adaptation for the 3 first episodes and these original scenes could expand more in the family’s dynamism mhm mhm. \n",

      "Another great episode. The show continues to hit on all cylinders. Seeing the Forger's all together was as wholesome and awesome to see as expected. Anya and her reactions continue to be adorable, and Yor and Loid shine too. A pretty simple, chill and laidback episode but a great episode nonetheless. Can't wait for the next.   BBCode\n",

While they're trying their best, they mess many things up which is expected from a newly made family but they're making progress. Anya with her assists is always great. LOL.

Lol the moment Anya holds Yor’s poisoned weapons that’s inside the box though. Also I supposed there was A LOT of original anime scenes in this episode when: Anya was room touring Yor and Yor and Loid had an extra interaction(?), not sure again, because I assured the manga was less heavier in the dialogue for the chapter they’re currently adapting here. \n",

      "\n",
      "Heck in order to solve that, they need to broaden their cultural knowledge by going to some performance art, museum, fine dining, etc, and I’m so excited to see Yuri’s appearance when Yor mentioned her care for him lol + Anya drawing in some wall was also another original anime scene, holy sheet so many unfamiliar scenes I’m pointing but it’s interesting they’re doing a 1:1 adaptation for the 3 first episodes and these original scenes could expand more in the family’s dynamism mhm mhm. \n",

Although Loid's patience is wearing, and Yor's sadistic tendencies are showing a little bit, when they and Anya really try, they look like one happy family. From walking in the park, to visiting a couple of functions, and that weird time where Loid downed a pickpocketing man, they sure are dynamic for a nuclear family.\n",
      "\n",
      "But seeing them connect for the first time is actually nice to see, it's all hazy from here on out but I'm sure they'll figure it out (with an upcoming F9 dead meme) as a family. One thing more to say is that ED...what more can you ask from a Gen Hoshino song to a wonderfully animated sequence, it is peak yet humbling anime ED. We're only getting to the fun part, but right now I'm already having joy watching.  BBCode\n",
