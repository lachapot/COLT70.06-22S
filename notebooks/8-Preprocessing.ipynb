    "## What is preprocessing and why is it important?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing are steps and procedures to take before using analyzing the texts in order to prepare your text data for analysis and make the results more meaningful. Text analysis methods require data to be structured in certain ways and will work better if the text data are prepared in certain ways. For example, most text analysis methods rely on matching the same sequences of characters in order to count them together, the more consistant the data is - the more the things we want counted together share the same sets of characters, the same spelling, etc - the better the outputs will be.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, preprocessing is about modifying and preparing the text data so that they work well with the methods you intend to use. Preprocessing steps are especially important when working with languages that are not Engish or that have features very different from English since there might be particular considerations and steps to take so that the text data work well with widely used text analysis methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no one-size-fits-all for preprocessing. Different methods, text data, questions and stages of anlaysis might require different kinds of preprocessing choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is preprocessing important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decisions made and the steps taken during preprocessing change influences the analysis and the outputs generated. And yet, as Nguyen et al. point out, preprocessing steps are often underreported and overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    ">“The pre-processing steps have a big impact on the operationalizations, subsequent analyses and reproducibility efforts (Fokkens et al., 2013), and they are usually tightly linked to what we intend to measure. Unfortunately, these steps tend to be underreported, but documenting the pre-processing choices made is essential” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also not always evident what the consequences our preprocessing chocies might be, which makes it even more crucial to be explicit about preprocessing procedures and document the steps taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "> “In unsupervised settings, it is more challenging to understand the effects of different steps. Inferences drawn from unsupervised settings can be sensitive to pre-processing choices (Denny and Spirling, 2018). (...) All in all, this again highlights the need to document these steps.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 8)"

Many historians, for example, work with text produced from an analog original using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Often, there will be limited information available regarding the accuracy of the OCR, and the degree of accuracy may even vary within a single corpus (e.g., where digitized text has been produced over a period of years, and the software has gradually improved). The first step, then, is to try to correct for common OCR errors. These will vary depending on the type of text, the date at which the “original” was produced, and the nature of the font and typesetting.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 7)\n",

Is “cool” different from “coooool”? Sometimes these steps can actively hide useful patterns, like social meaning (Eisenstein, 2013). Some of us therefore try do as little modification as possible.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 8)"

    "English has minimal inflection (e.g. words can be inflected by number: \"cat\" becomes \"cats\" in the plural). Other languages, however, have much more inflection. Words can vary, for example, according to whether the word is definite or indefinite, and also according to number and gender. For example in Swedish, not only could there be three different forms for \"little\" - \"litet\", \"liten\", \"lilla\", but there are also four different forms for \"coat\" (jacka, jackan, jackor, jackorna) and \"apple\" (äpple, äpplet, äpplen, äpplena), depending on gender and whether they’re plural or singular and definite or indefinite (whereas in English there would only be two different forms: plural and singular). When working with methods that rely on word counts, and on grouping words we consider the \"same\" together, these inflectional forms need to be grouped together. Stemming and lemmatization are two processes to reduce inflectional forms to a base form, but they do it in slightly different ways."

For these languages, unseen data is far more likely to include previously-unseen inflections, and therefore, dealing with inflections is more important. On the other hand, the resources for handling inflections vary greatly by language, with European languages dominating the attention of the computational linguistics community thus far.” (Nguyen et al. “How We Do Things With Words”, p. 8)"
