Location in Hamsun’s Turn-of-the-
Century Short Stories

In his illuminating study of Hamsun’s novels of disillusion-
ment, Luft, vind, ingenting (Air, Wind, Nothing), the
Norwegian literary scholar Atle Kittang has suggested that the
typical Hamsun hero is the wanderer, the man without a home
whose favoured mode of existence is the restless moving or
drifting through places. This type of hero is engaged in the
crossing of boundaries and belongs, Kittang argues, to a
permanent symbolical borderland.! Kittang’s observations are
interesting, among other reasons, in that they so firmly
interlink person and place — landscape and characterisation — in
Hamsun’s literary work. Although they are made within the
context of a study of novels, Kittang’s reflections would seem
of relevance also to Hamsun’s short fiction.

In recent years, a good deal of critical emphasis has been
placed on examining the meaning of topography — the writing
of the place — in narrative fiction.2 The majority of such
studies have referred to or selected their cases from the genre
of the novel, highlighting, among other aspects, the ‘thick-
ness’ and ‘interiority’ which are seen as characteristic of the
